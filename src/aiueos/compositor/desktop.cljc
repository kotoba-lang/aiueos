  guest surface are a kami.webgpu.ir-shaped EDN frame hosted in a
  window's `:kami` content; the browser WebGPU canvas is the scanout host.

  Hosted WM (ADR-0085): two overlapping surfaces, `raise` changes
  z-order, pointer hit-test is front-to-back, DADS title bars live in
  `apps/session` `#desktop`. Hosted IME is ADR-0086 (romaji→kana
