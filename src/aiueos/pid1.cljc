  `aiueos.launcher/up-command`, and then -- UNLIKE the old Rust placeholder,

  all -- actually does the things being PID 1 requires:

  - reaps zombies: every process whose parent dies gets reparented to PID 1,
    and PID 1 must `waitpid` them or they pile up as defunct zombies forever
    (there is no init above PID 1 to reap ITS zombies).
  - handles `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` (`sun.misc.Signal` -- a public, exported-since-
    JDK9 API, no `--add-opens` needed) as a clean-shutdown request instead of
    the JVM's default (which would just die, leaving the kernel with no PID 1
    and typically panicking).
  - powers off / reboots via the real Linux `reboot(2)` syscall
    (`java.lang.foreign`, matching `aiueos.vfio`'s FFM pattern) instead of
    silently returning.

  JVM-only (`#?(:clj ...)` throughout, same reason as `aiueos.execute`/

;; ── the anchors the image booted with ──────────────────────────────────────

;; ADR-0047 put the bootstrap anchor set in the image and nothing read it. This
;; reads it.
;;
;; **Where the trust comes from, stated plainly:** the document's integrity is
;; the *image's* integrity. Re-checking a publisher signature over the file at
;; PID-1 time would add nothing when the image was verified, and could not fix
;; anything when it was not — PID 1 is already running code from that image. So
;; this loads and validates the document; it does not re-admit it. What the
;; hosted profile therefore inherits is whatever verified the image, which today
;; is nothing (the bare-metal profile has measured Secure Boot; this one does
;; not). That is a gap in the boot path, not something a later parse can repair.
;;
;; Three outcomes, deliberately distinct, because the difference between them
;; is the difference between a safe machine and a broken one:
;;
;;   no `:aiueos/anchors`  -> boots with no pins. Existing images stay valid,
;;                            and the boot config says the file was absent.
;;   named and unreadable  -> **refuses to boot.** A machine that boots with a
;;                            broken pin file reaches nothing and looks fine;
;;                            failing here says which file and why.
;;   named and valid       -> boots with `:aiueos.cloud/trust-anchors` set.
