  "Machine-verifiable trusted-computing-base inventory.

  Two halves, both fail-closed:

  - **in-repository sources** (`:tcb/files`) are pinned by SHA-256 of the file
    itself, so changing trusted code without an inventory update fails;
  - **external dependencies** (`:tcb/external`) are pinned by *content*, not by
    a path or a bare version string, and cross-checked against the two other
    records of the same fact (`deps.edn`, `security-adoption.edn`) so the three
    cannot silently disagree.

  A Maven dependency's content address is the SHA-256 of its resolved jar; a git
  dependency's is its commit id (git's own content address for the tree). An
  entry that is neither content-addressable nor carrying an explicit
  `:assurance-gap` is an error — an unpinned dependency may not pass silently."
