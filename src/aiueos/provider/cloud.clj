(ns aiueos.provider.cloud
  "The hosted-profile mechanism behind `grant.cloud`: the part that actually
  opens the connection.

  `grant.cloud` decides which request this policy would allow and whether a
  response is the one that was asked for. This namespace does neither. It takes
  an allowed plan, performs it, and reports **what arrived** — status, byte
  count, and the SHA-256 of the bytes it received. The comparison against the
  digest the CID commits to stays in `grant.cloud/admit-block`, because the
  question \"what did I get\" and the question \"is that what was asked for\"
  have different answers and must not be answered by the same code.

  JVM-only, like `aiueos.provider.device`. No new dependency: `java.net.http`
  is the platform's, and TLS comes with it.

  ## Three things that are mechanism here and would be holes anywhere else

  **Redirects are not followed.** The allowlist checked the URL *we* chose, not
  the one the server names next. A followed 302 would leave the allowlist behind
  while still looking like a successful fetch — the same shape as the murakumo
  alias redirect that `grant.cloud/admit-model` re-checks, arriving one layer
  lower. A redirect is returned as its status and refused by `admit-block`.

  **The body is read against a ceiling.** A hostile or broken endpoint that
  never stops sending would otherwise decide how much memory this machine
  spends. The default ceiling is kotobase's own 4 MiB block limit: a response
  above it cannot be a block this store would have accepted.

  **A request that could not complete is not a response.** Timeouts and I/O
  failures produce `:aiueos.provider.cloud/error`, never a `:digest-hex` and
  never a status. `admit-block` must not be handed something it could mistake
  for a measurement.

  ## Credentials arrive; they are never held

  Any authorization header is an **injected value** in `opts`. This namespace
  has no default, reads no environment variable, and holds no credential of its
  own. Headers are applied to the request and are not carried onto the result,
  so a credential cannot reach a receipt, a log line or an exception message by
  travelling with the thing that was measured. `:post` and `:put` exist here
  because plans emit them; the authority to use them is somebody else's to
  supply.

  ## The platform trust store is replaced, not extended

  An https connection is trusted because its leaf key is one the policy named
  **for the host being reached**, and for no other reason. The JDK's default
  trust store — several hundred anchors chosen by whoever packaged the runtime
  — is not consulted: it is a reasonable default for a browser reaching hosts
  nobody enumerated in advance, and the wrong one for a machine that talks to
  three authorities known before it boots. The measurement is this
  namespace's; the verdict is `grant.cloud/admit-peer`'s.

  The host comes from the URL the plan named, and reaches the trust manager
  because the client is built per request. That is also why redirects staying
  off is now load-bearing twice over: a followed redirect would reach a host
  other than the one this client was built to judge.

  ## What this does not do

  It is the *hosted* profile only; the bare-metal profile still has no TLS or
  HTTP client (ADR-0041 gap ledger, steps 1–5).

  `write-block!` performs the `PUT` that `grant.cloud/plan-block-write`
  plans, and the credential it needs is a **bearer token**, not a CACAO:
  kotobase's block plane admits `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against a
  static operator secret, while CACAO belongs to its tenant datom plane. This
  machine holds no such token, and the live endpoint answers **401** without
  one — measured 2026-08-21. The mechanism exists and is proved against a
  loopback server in both directions; the live write is unauthorised, which is
  a different sentence from unimplemented."
