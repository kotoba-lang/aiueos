(ns aiueos.provider.cloud-own
  "The same requests as `aiueos.provider.cloud`, over this workspace's own TLS
  and HTTP instead of the platform's.

  `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tls` moves the bytes and `kotoba.lang.http.wire` frames
  them. Neither knows about the other: the whole of the coupling is
  `tls-transport` below, which turns `tls.client/write!` and `read!` into the
  `{:write :read}` pair the wire layer asks for. That seam is the reason this
  is twenty lines of adapter rather than a third HTTP client.

  ## Why this lives beside the consumer and not in a repository of its own

  The adapter is small; what is *not* small is the policy it carries -- that
  redirects are never followed, that a body over the ceiling is refused rather
  than truncated, that a request which could not complete yields no status and
  no digest, and that the peer verdict is `grant.cloud/admit-peer`'s. Those are
  decisions about what this machine will act on, and they belong with the
  machine. The trigger for extracting a shared library is a *second* consumer,
  not this one.

  ## `admit-peer` is the only pin check

  `tls.client` can authenticate a peer against a pin itself. It is not asked
  to. It is handed a `:verify-chain` function that measures the leaf's
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo -- with `tls.cert/spki-sha256-hex`, which is the same
  digest of the same DER that `PublicKey.getEncoded` gives the platform path --
  and then asks `grant.cloud/admit-peer`, which is the same question the
  platform path's trust manager asks.

  One pin check, in the decision plane, on both paths. Two would eventually
  disagree, and the failure mode of a disagreement here is that a peer one
  layer refused another layer already accepted.

  ## What an `[:ok …]` from the peer check does NOT mean

  The same set as the platform path, because the platform path was measured
  and not assumed. On 2026-08-22 a certificate whose only subjectAltName is
  `IP:127.0.0.1`, reached as `localhost`, was **accepted** by
  `aiueos.provider.cloud` -- so `java.net.http` with a custom trust manager
  checks no server name either. Neither path validates a chain to a trust
  anchor, checks revocation, checks certificate transparency, checks name
  constraints, verifies the leaf's issuer signature, checks validity dates, or
  matches the certificate against the name it was reached by. The pin, bound to
  the host by policy, is the whole of the trust decision on both.

  ## What is still the platform's on this path

  The *protocol* is this workspace's: the record layer, the key schedule, the
  handshake state machine, certificate parsing and HTTP/1.1 framing. The
  *primitives* are not -- `tls.provider.jvm` is the JDK's AES-GCM, SHA-256,
  HMAC, X25519 and ECDSA, and the socket is `java.net.Socket`. Calling this
  path \"no JDK\" would be false; what left is `java.net.http`."
