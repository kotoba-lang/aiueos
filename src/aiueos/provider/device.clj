  "The device half of enrolment, as mechanism rather than decision.

  `grant.enroll` decides whether a claim may bind a device to an owner, and it
  refuses to decide without a verified `:possession-proof-valid?`. This
  namespace is what produces and checks that answer: it generates the
  operational key on the device, signs an enrolment challenge with it, and
  verifies such a signature against an expected challenge.

  JVM-only, like `grant.key-lifecycle` and `aiueos.entropy` — key custody is a
  host concern and there is no portable answer to it. No new dependency: the
  Ed25519 primitives are the JDK's, reached through `grant.key-lifecycle`.

  ## The private key is generated here and never leaves

  `generate-operational-keypair!` is the only place a device key comes into
  existence. What crosses the wire afterwards is the *public* half plus a
  signature — never the private key, and never a seed it could be derived from.
  That is what makes \"per-device keys\" a real property rather than a naming
  convention over one operator secret.

  ## Naming is deliberately not done here

  A `did:key` is a public key in a particular multibase/multicodec envelope, and
  the library that owns that envelope is `kotoba-lang/org-w3-did`. aiueos is
  dependency-minimal by invariant (its `deps.edn` carries the shared security
  package and Chicory, nothing else), so it exports the raw public key and lets
  the fleet plane name it. **The device owns the key; the fleet owns the name.**

  ## What a proof has to bind, and why each binding is there

  A signature over a bare nonce proves possession of *a* key at *some* point,
  which is not the question. `challenge` binds four things and verification
  checks all of them:

  - the **public key**, so a proof made by one device cannot be replayed for
    another;
  - the **nonce**, so a proof cannot be replayed at all;
  - the **endpoint**, so a proof harvested by one enrolment service cannot be
    presented to a different one;
  - the **purpose**, so an enrolment proof cannot be lifted into a different
    protocol that happens to sign the same shape."
