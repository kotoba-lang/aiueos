  "P3: one grant-limited Kotoba guest visible in the hosted daily shell.

  Identity is `examples/apps/notes.edn` (`:app/notes`). Grant decides;
  `aiueos.execute` runs Wasm only after `:grant`. POSIX `:fs/open` in the
  on-disk fixture is the named deny (no fs provider in this shell — local
  disk write is P3 red). The hosted allow path drops that import and keeps
  kernel `:log/write`, which Chicory can actually link.

  Kotobase round-trip is the session process, not a guest-local file.
  A write that the authority answers 401 is `:write-unauthorized`, never
  a successful store.

  JVM-only for execute + sockets (`#?(:clj …)`), same as `aiueos.execute`."
