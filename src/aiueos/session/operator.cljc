  "P4: itonami operator plane from the same hosted daily shell.

  Consumer kotobase/murakumo stays in `aiueos.session.live` and
  `resources/aiueos/cloud_live.edn`. This namespace is the industrial
  path: grant first, then this process GETs live itonami.cloud.
  Without the operator grant the socket must not open
  (root ADR-2608221625).

  Deny import is `:itonami/operator`, which grant does not resolve —
  public reason `:operator-grant-required`. Allow drops that import so
  grant admits, then HTTP uses `resources/aiueos/operator_itonami.edn`
  (itonami.cloud only)."
