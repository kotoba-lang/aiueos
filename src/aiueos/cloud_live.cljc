  "The gate that leaves this machine.

  Everything else in this repository proves its cloud story against a loopback
  server, which is the right place to prove a seam and the wrong place to learn
  that a pin is stale or that an authority renamed a field. This runs the same
  code against the real `kotobase.net`, `api.murakumo.cloud` and the endpoint
  the model alias resolves onto, and prints what it measured.

  ## An operator runs this, not the fleet

  The murakumo fleet holds no credentials by invariant, and its nodes' egress is
  not uniform -- measured across this workspace more than once, and the reason
  `scripts/fleet-ci` is told to measure reachability rather than assume it. A
  gate that needs an open path to three named hosts, and a token for one of
  them, is an operator's to run. It is therefore an alias, not a fleet gate.

  ## Three exit codes, because there are three answers

  - **0** every leg that was attempted was admitted;
  - **1** a leg was refused -- a pin did not match, a digest did not match, an
    endpoint was outside the allowlist. Something is wrong;
  - **3** a leg could not be answered -- no network, no route, nothing to ask.
    Nothing is known to be wrong and nothing was established either.

  Root ADR-2608136000 is explicit that a check which could not run must never
  return the value of a check that ran and found nothing wrong. The usual way
  that rule gets broken is not by lying, it is by having only two exit codes and
  rounding. So the receipt prints the word UNMEASURED next to the leg and the
  reason it could not answer, and `exit-code` prefers 1 over 3 over 0: a real
  refusal is never hidden behind a leg that was skipped.

  A refusal by the authority is a refusal: a 401 exits 1, whether or not this
  machine had a credential to send. That is not a judgement about the operator's
  environment, it is the gate saying the machine could not do the thing it is
  configured to do -- and the receipt carries `:credential :absent` so the
  reason is legible rather than mysterious.

  ## Why the split down the middle

  The decision rule -- what counts as admitted, refused or unanswerable, and
  which exit code follows -- is portable and sits in the open. The gate itself
  is sockets, TLS and a process exit code, and is behind `#?(:clj …)`. That is
  not tidiness: a rule that can only be exercised by running it against the
  internet is a rule nothing checks, and the exit code is the whole product.

  ## A credential is attached, never required

  If the environment carries the token the policy names, it goes on the request.
  If it does not, the request is made anyway and whatever the authority answers
  is judged. Requiring one would make the inference leg unfalsifiable on the
  endpoint that does not need one.

  ## What it never prints

  A credential. The environment variable's *name* appears in the receipt, so a
  reader knows which one to set; the value reaches a request header and nothing
  else."
