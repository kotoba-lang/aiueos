(ns aiueos.reproducibility
  "Reproducibility evidence for a release, computed where it can be computed.

  `kotoba.security.supply-chain/evaluate-reproducibility` has been able to judge
  a release's reproducibility for as long as it has existed, and nothing in this
  repository ever called it. `docs/deployment-profiles.md` names \"reproducible,
  signed, independently verified release pipeline\" as a `:regulated`
  requirement, and `grant.deployment-profile` checked the signed half and not
  the reproducible half.

  That is the same shape ADR-0016 and ADR-0017 each removed once already: a
  control exists, its evaluator exists, and the evidence it consumes is a
  placeholder. An evaluator with no caller at all is the degenerate case.

  Two of the evaluator's inputs are *derived* from records this repository
  already keeps fail-closed, so they are derived rather than asserted:

  - `:dependencies` come from the TCB inventory's git entries, and each one's
    `:dependency/exact-fetch` is checked against the checkout the running JVM
    actually resolved;
  - `:local-overrides?` is measured the same way. A `:local/root` override
    replaces a dependency's git checkout on the classpath, so a pinned git
    dependency the classpath cannot account for *is* the override.

  The rest — `fresh-clone?`, `hermetic?`, and the two artifact digests — are
  claims about a build environment this namespace cannot inspect. They are
  required from the caller and never defaulted to true, for the same reason
  `aiueos.sbom/provenance` requires `isolated-builder?`: a default would make
  every local build claim the property the document exists to establish."
