  "P1 hosted daily shell gate. Boots the DADS SPA over HTTP and, from that
  same process, reads a kotobase CID and completes a murakumo infer.

  P3 (`guest`) is a separate command: grant-limited `:app/notes` visible
  in this same document. Do not fold execute into P1 smoke.

  Exit 0 = SPA served and both live legs admitted.
  Exit 1 = a leg was refused, or the document is not the DADS SPA.
  Exit 3 = a leg could not be answered.

  QEMU is not this gate. Phone bind is `clojure -M:phone-bind smoke`."
