  "The aiueos CLI binary itself, per ADR-2607022700/2607022900: the retired
  Rust `bin/aiueos.rs` argv-parsing/file-I/O role, reimplemented as JVM
  Clojure. Ties together `aiueos.cli` (command/request shaping),
  `aiueos.manifest` (normalization), `aiueos.policy`/`aiueos.broker`
  (decisions), and `aiueos.execute` (real Chicory execution) into a single
  runnable entry point.

  This is deliberately NOT the same thing as `aiueos.decide` (the
  bb-runnable, decision-only EDN-over-stdio subprocess for host adapters
  without Chicory available). `aiueos.launcher` is the JVM-specific,
  execution-capable launcher: `run`/`admit` here ACTUALLY EXECUTE a granted
  component via `aiueos.execute`, not just report `:host-action
  :adapter-required` like `aiueos.cli/command-result` does generically for
  a host-neutral caller.

  JVM-only (`#?(:clj ...)` throughout) -- file I/O and `aiueos.execute`'s
  Chicory dependency both require it; not runnable under babashka."
