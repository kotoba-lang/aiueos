(ns aiueos.image
  "`aiueos image build` -- ports the retired Rust `InitramfsPlan`
  (`bin/aiueos.rs`, ADR-0008) to CLJC per ADR-0011: stage a directory
  (`/init`, `/etc/aiueos/boot.edn`, the system graph, an optional policy, and
  -- new in this JVM port, since `/init` can no longer be a single native
  binary -- a jlink-produced minimal JRE and the aiueos jar), then shell out
  to `cpio`/`gzip` exactly like the old binary did (staging + packaging is
  ordinary file I/O; there's no reason to hand-roll a `newc` cpio encoder
  when the OS already ships one).

  NOT carried over from the retired Rust: `InitramfsPlan::verify` (which
  re-ran the SAME broker/policy verification `aiueos.launcher/verify-command`
  already does elsewhere in this CLJC port) is not re-wired here yet --
  calling `aiueos.launcher/verify-command`/`up-command` on the system before
  `build-initramfs!` is a documented follow-up, not silently skipped
  forever, but also not duplicated inline in this namespace.

  JVM-only (`#?(:clj ...)` throughout) -- file I/O, same as `aiueos.launcher`."
