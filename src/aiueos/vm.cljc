  namespace, which only launches QEMU itself.

  this one, because the fact lives on the launcher's plan and
  `aiueos.deployment-profile` judges a boot config from inside the guest — the
  two never meet.

  They still do not. **What this adds is the host declaring its own intent**:
  a launcher told it is starting a production machine refuses to boot artifacts
  it could not check. It says nothing about whether the guest's own
  `boot.edn` agrees, because the launcher does not read the guest's config, and
  a rule that claimed agreement it never checked would be worse than the note it
  replaced (ADR-0069)."
