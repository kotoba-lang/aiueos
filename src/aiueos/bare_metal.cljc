  kotobase itself.

  Root ADR-2608221625 / aiueos ADR-0041 steps 1–5 / ADR-0081.

  `clojure -M:cloud-live check` is the hosted JVM profile. `clojure -M:session
  smoke` is the session process on the Mac host. Neither greens this gate.
  Fetching kotobase from this process is named `:host-fetch-does-not-count`.

  Exit 0 = the guest performed HTTPS GET (or `/ipfs/:cid`) with CID
  verification. Exit 1 = a leftover the serial named, or a host fetch
  standing in. Exit 3 = QEMU / OVMF / serial could not be answered.

  Command: `clojure -M:bare-metal cloud`"
