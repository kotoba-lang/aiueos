# Trusted computing base inventory

Status: machine checked  
Inventory version: 3  
Date: 2026-08-01

The authoritative inventory is
`qualification/tcb-inventory.edn`. It lists every in-repository source boundary
whose compromise can grant authority, escape Wasm isolation, falsify
production admission or audit evidence, or access hardware outside a
component. Each entry has a role and SHA-256 digest.

Run:

```sh
clojure -M:tcb-check
```

The check fails on missing files, duplicate paths, unsupported inventory
versions, missing roles or any source digest drift. Regulated boot evidence
must bind the inventory digest and assert that this check passed.

## External dependencies are content-addressed (version 2)

`:tcb/external` records the same kind of fact for code this repository does not
contain. A dependency is pinned by *content*, never by a path or a bare version
string:

| source | content address | verified against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:maven` | SHA-256 of the resolved jar | the jar in the local Maven repository the running JVM resolved from |
| `:git` | `:git-sha` (git's own content address for the tree) | `deps.edn`, and `security-adoption.edn` for the shared security package |
| `:platform` | none possible from inside this repository | must carry an explicit `:assurance-gap` |

Three checks make the record non-decorative, all fail-closed:

1. **no unpinned dependency** — an entry with neither a content address nor a
   declared `:assurance-gap` is an error;
2. **no silent drift** — the inventory's version/commit must equal `deps.edn`'s,
   and the shared security commit must also equal `security-adoption.edn`'s, so
   the three records of one fact cannot disagree;
3. **no dependency outside the inventory** — every coordinate in `deps.edn`'s
   `:deps` must appear in `:tcb/external`.

The digest check cannot be skipped by an unresolved environment: the jars must
already be resolved for the JVM running the check to have started.

Version 1 recorded the external TCB as unverified prose, and had drifted — the
shared security package was recorded as a local-root path while `deps.edn` had
moved to a commit pin, and `io.github.kotoba-lang/abi` was absent entirely.
Both are the classes of error the checks above now reject.

## Included boundaries

- authority schema, manifest identity, signing, signer lifecycle, policy and
  broker;
- Wasm host ABI, security entropy provider, hard watchdog, launch control,
  local topic isolation,
  authenticated network-topic protocol, graph and provider surface;
- deployment admission and PID-1;
- plaintext audit emission, sealed production audit and component-state
  storage;
- HVT, VFIO/IOMMU, virtio, VM launch and boot-image construction.

The external TCB records the Chicory parser/runtime jars, the shared security
package, the freestanding ABI contract, and `java.base`.

`:tcb/classpath` records the transitive closure `:tcb/external` cannot express:
every jar actually on the running classpath, by SHA-256. `org.clojure/clojure`,
`spec.alpha` and `core.specs.alpha` reach it via dependencies and are named by
no `:deps` entry — and the loaded clojure is 1.12.5 where the declaration says
1.12.4. A jar on the classpath and not recorded is an error; recorded-but-absent
is not, because the check runs under more than one alias. Regenerate digests
with `clojure -M:test:tcb-check classpath`; roles are a human judgement and are
not generated.

## Evidence still required

Digest pinning detects unreviewed drift but does not establish correctness.
A-02 remains incomplete until the inventory is independently reviewed, the
broker/grant/link invariants receive selected formal models, and the
hypervisor/runtime boundary receives an escape-oriented penetration test and
retest.

One scope limit is recorded rather than hidden (ADR-0016):

- `java.base` carries `:minimum-version 25` and cannot be content-addressed from
  inside this repository, so nothing verifies it. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  provisions temurin 21, which does not satisfy that floor; whether the floor or
  the runner is wrong is unresolved.
