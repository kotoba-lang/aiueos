;; Gate N2 host-side integration scaffold (ADR-0134, branch n2-design-only).
;;
;; The kernel's reassembly will import `tcp.seq-core` and
;; `tcp.reassemble-core` from kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tcp — the same objects,
;; at the same commit the `:test` alias pins (d8c15e23b6c169a4ed044cd7764923
;; ecbb789be4) — and the runtime profile's correctness rests on three
;; properties the ADR names:
;;
;;   P1  out-of-order segments are ordered by FORWARD DISTANCE from rcv-nxt,
;;       not by raw sequence number — across the 2^32 wrap the raw numbers
;;       sort backwards;
;;   P2  the held-queue bound is charged on what STAYS HELD, not on what
;;       arrives — in-order data is delivered and never occupies the queue;
;;   P3  delivery is contiguous: bytes leave in stream order in one delivered
;;       run per accept, and rcv-nxt advances across the wrap.
;;
;; This file drives the pinned kotoba objects through the KIR interpreter —
;; the same route the kernel's objects will take — and requires them to agree
;; with the `tcp.reassemble` reference on the SAME fixtures the org-ietf-tcp
;; parity suite uses: points straddling the wrap (0, 4294967286, 4294967295,
;; the 2^31 antipode), lengths 0/1/10/100, and max-bytes at and around the
;; bound. A uniform sample of a 2^32 space lands on none of the values where
;; this namespace has historically gone wrong (reassemble_core.kotoba's own
;; header documents two such bugs).
;;
;; This is a skeleton by design: the kernel source is NOT modified on this
;; branch. What is pinned here is the contract the import integration (see
;; scripts/k16-n2-import-integration-sketch.patch) must satisfy before
;; `native/tcp-stream.kotoba` links the cores.
