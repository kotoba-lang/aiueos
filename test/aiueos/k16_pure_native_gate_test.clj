  "The K16 pure-native gate, shown in both directions (ADR-0131).

  Every negative here pins the REASON LITERAL, not just the exit code. A gate
  that goes red for a different cause than the one under test has not
  discriminated anything -- root ADR-2608136000's sixth question -- and this
  namespace is where that claim is kept honest: `object-sha256-mismatch` and
  `sections` are both exit 3, and confusing them would hide the difference
