;; `tcp-checksum-ok.kotoba` against the RFC 1071 identity.
;;
;; The object verifies a TCP segment over the IPv4 pseudo-header. Its own
;; comment states the verification identity: summing a header whose checksum
;; field already carries the complement yields 0xffff, so a correct header
;; complements to exactly 0. This test drives the object through the KIR
;; interpreter with a bounded kernel-memory region and requires it to agree
;; with a direct RFC 1071 oracle, with the interesting cases stated rather
;; than sampled: the odd-length padding rule, a corrupted payload byte, and
;; the checksum field stored at the right offset.
;;
;; `tcp-seq-acceptable-parity-test` is the model; this is its checksum
;; sibling. Like that test, this does not wire the object into the rx path —
;; the physical call-site change belongs to the aiueos-handoff gate
;; (:incoming-checksum-admission :deferred-to-next-gate in
;; pure-kotoba-tcp-k16-v1.edn).
