;; `tcp-seq-acceptable.kotoba` against `tcp.seq/acceptable?`.
;;
;; The object holds RFC 9293 §3.10.7.4, which this OS did not have. Its
;; neighbour `tcp-segment-valid.kotoba` admits a segment from the Ethernet
;; header up -- envelope, exact flags, acknowledgement number -- and says of
;; itself that the arity is spent before it reaches the window question. So the
;; kernel could tell that a segment was well formed and came from the peer, and
;; could not tell whether it belonged in the window.
;;
;; A kernel object exports one entry and cannot call another (ADR-0030), so the
;; wrap arithmetic in that object is a copy of what kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tcp
;; holds. This is what stops the copy from being a claim: it drives the object
;; through the KIR interpreter and requires it to agree with `tcp.seq` on every
;; input, and the inputs are chosen around the 2^32 wrap rather than uniformly.
;; A uniform sample of a 2^32 space lands on none of the interesting values.
;;
;; The object is not linked into anything yet, and the reachability test says so
;; with the reason. Wiring it means giving the probe in `kernel/pci.c` a second
;; call site, which is a change to the kernel and belongs in its own commit.
