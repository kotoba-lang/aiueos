  "The value-runtime receipt is honest, and its failure count only goes down.

  This does not compile anything — `aiueos.verify-value-runtime-all` does, and
  it needs the compiler closure. What this asserts is that the written-down
  measurement still describes the repository it claims to: the same compiler,
  every object accounted for, and a failure count that has not grown.

  A receipt is only worth its closure. If someone advances the compiler pin and
  does not re-measure, these numbers stop being about this repository — so the
  sha is checked, and a stale receipt is red rather than quietly quoted."

  It was ten until the composite image verifier was added to the run (ADR-0057)

  failure of the two — so the pair moves together and the passing floor below
