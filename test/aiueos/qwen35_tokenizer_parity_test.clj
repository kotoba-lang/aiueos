;; The three tokenizer objects against a transcription of llama.cpp's
;; `llm_tokenizer_bpe`, and the pre-tokenizer against a real regex engine.
;;
;; ## What the oracle is, and what it is not
;;
;; THE ACCEPTANCE ORACLE FOR THIS FAMILY IS llama.cpp, AND IT WAS NOT
;; AVAILABLE. Measured 2026-09-02 on the workstation this ran on: no
;; `llama-tokenize` on PATH, no llama.cpp under Homebrew (`brew --prefix
;; llama.cpp` names a directory that does not exist), no `.gguf` over 10 MB
;; anywhere under `/Users` or `/Volumes`, and no ollama blobs. So there are no
;; golden token ids from the reference implementation, for this or any other
;; Qwen vocabulary, and this file does not pretend otherwise.
;;
;; What it has instead, in descending order of independence:
;;
;;   1. THE PRE-TOKENIZER AGAINST java.util.regex. The byte state machine in
;;      `qwen35-tokenize.kotoba` is checked against the qwen2 regex run through
;;      a real regex engine with real Unicode property support. That is a
;;      genuinely independent implementation of the hardest and most
;;      error-prone stage, and it is where a hand-written splitter goes wrong.
;;   2. THE CHARACTER CLASSES AGAINST java.util.regex, exhaustively. Every
;;      codepoint of the 24 blocks the object declares is classified by the
;;      object and by `\p{L}` / `\p{N}` and the two are compared -- at every
;;      codepoint where Java's answer CHANGES, at the codepoint either side of
;;      it, and on a stride through each block. The test also counts the
;;      codepoints OUTSIDE those blocks that Java calls a letter or a number,
;;      so the size of the object's blind spot is printed rather than hoped
;;      about.
;;   3. THE MERGE LOOP AND THE ID LOOKUP AGAINST A TRANSCRIPTION. `oracle-ids`
;;      below is llama.cpp's algorithm rewritten in Clojure over maps and
;;      vectors. It shares no code with the object, but it does share an
;;      author, so it catches a coding mistake and not a misreading.
;;   4. ROUND TRIP. `detokenize(tokenize(s)) = s` for every vector, which
;;      needs no oracle at all and is the property a chat loop depends on.
;;
;; The two portable tokenizers in this workspace (`torch.tokenizer` and
;; `kotodama.inference.tokenizer`) were read and are NOT used: both implement
;; SentencePiece-flavoured BPE -- a `U+2581` word-boundary marker and
;; `<0xHH>` byte-fallback tokens -- with no GPT-2 byte-to-unicode alphabet and
;; no pre-tokenizer split at all. Against a `gpt2` vocabulary they are a
;; different algorithm, not a second opinion.
;;
;; ## The fixture
;;
;; A mini vocabulary, built here: the 256 byte-alphabet characters, then the
;; result of every merge rule a small BPE trainer produced from the vector
;; corpus itself, then three special tokens with `token_type` set. That keeps
;; the invariant `vocab-index-build` refuses without (`-13`/`-14`): every merge
;; side is a vocabulary token, because every merge side is either one of the
;; 256 or an earlier merge's result.
;;
;; The real 248,320-entry vocabulary is NOT exercised, because there is no
;; GGUF on this machine to read it from. The objects derive every table size
;; from the workspace header rather than from the contract's counts, so the
;; same code serves both; that is a property of the source, not a measurement.
;;
;; ## What this does NOT execute
;;
;; The emitted x86-64. This workstation is aarch64 and the objects compile to
;; ET_REL kernel objects. `kotoba.kir` models the same window checks the
;; backends emit, so this is an oracle for the bounds as well as the
;; arithmetic -- but it is not the machine.
