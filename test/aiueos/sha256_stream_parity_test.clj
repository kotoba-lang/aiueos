(ns aiueos.sha256-stream-parity-test
  "Every digest the streaming SHA-256 objects are checked against, re-derived
  by an implementation that is not theirs.

  ## What this is for

  `verify-admissions.cljs` runs the objects and compares what they wrote
  against the `:digest-hex` in their contracts. That answers \"does the object
  agree with the contract\" and NOT \"is the contract right\" -- and a contract
  is where a transcription error lands. A digest copied one nibble wrong makes
  a correct object look broken; a digest copied from the WRONG INPUT makes a
  broken object look correct.

  So every expectation in the three contracts is recomputed here from the
  message the contract itself describes, using `sha2.core` from
  kotoba-lang/org-nist-sha2 -- a pure `.cljc` SHA-256 that shares no code, no
  author and no representation with `aiueos.lib.sha256-stream`.

  ## And the literals in the kernel

  `kernel/main.c` carries two 64-character digests as C string literals: they
  were transcribed by hand into `worker_canonical_v3_expected` when ADR-0137
  landed, because nothing on the device could compute them. This checks that
  those two literals are exactly `input-sha256([248044 9707 11 1879], 64)` and
  `output-sha256([2005 17 42])` under the server's published byte form -- which
  is what `aiueos-device-worker-digest` now computes at boot, in case 7 and
  case 8 of SHA-STREAM-PARITY.

  ## Evidence floor

  Every deftest here prints `SCANNED\\t<n>` and asserts a floor. A run that
  found no contracts, or a contract with no digests in it, must not return what
  a run that checked all of them returns."
