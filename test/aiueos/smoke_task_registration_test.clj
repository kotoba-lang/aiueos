  "Every nbb smoke is reachable from `scripts/tasks.edn`.

  ## Why only the nbb ones

  `tasks.edn` says why the bare-metal `.sh` chain is deliberately not behind
  nbb: those are the OS's own dependency-minimal build tools, and running them
  through Node would put Node in the boot-evidence path. That is a decision,
  not an oversight, and a gate that ignored it would be demanding the repository
  contradict itself.

  A smoke *written in nbb* has no such objection — it is already Node — so
  there is no reason for it to be unreachable, and one for it to be reachable:
  `tasks.edn`'s own comment records that the multiboot smoke went uninvoked
  until a build break reached main and sat there.

  ## What this does not claim

  Being registered is not being run. Nothing in this repository runs
  `tasks.edn` on a schedule; registration makes a gate findable and nameable,
  which is the difference between a script and a script nobody knows about.
  **The census below is the honest part**: measured 2026-08-18, 13 of the 18
  QEMU smokes have no invocation site anywhere in `scripts/` or
  `os/aiueos/scripts/`, and most of those are entry points meant to be run by
  hand — which is a statement about how this OS is tested, not a defect list."
