(ns aiueos.cloud-contract-paths-test
  "The contract lives in `kotoba-lang/grant` and names files in this
  repository. This is the test that checks they are still here.

  `resources/aiueos/cloud_contract.edn` is `grant`'s, and it deliberately names
  `src/aiueos/provider/cloud.clj`, `src/aiueos/cloud_live.cljc` and
  `resources/aiueos/cloud_live.edn` — because a contract that stopped naming
  its own mechanism the day the mechanism moved to another repository would
  describe half a story. The cost of that decision is a claim that crosses a
  repository boundary, and until now nothing checked it: a rename here broke a
  sentence there, silently.

  It cannot be checked from `grant`, which has no way to see this tree — the
  edge is one-way and that is the point (root ADR-2608219500). So the check
  lives where the files do, and `grant.cloud-test` checks the half that lives
  there. Two tests, one contract, neither able to do the other's job.

  ## What this refuses to do

  Report a pass it did not earn. Three ways this could return green without
  checking anything, each turned into a failure:

  - the contract is not on the classpath — it would find no paths and check
    none of them;
  - the test is run from somewhere that is not the repository root — every
    relative path would be missing, or worse, present by accident;
  - the contract stops naming this repository at all — zero paths checked is
    not the same result as every path checked, and the floor says so.

  Root ADR-2608136000: a check that could not run must never return the value
  of a check that ran and found nothing wrong."
