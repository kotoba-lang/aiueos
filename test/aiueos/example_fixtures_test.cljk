  "The example manifests, systems and policies under `examples/`, checked
  against the authority contracts that now live in `kotoba-lang/grant`.

  This deftest and its helpers were lifted out of the contract test that is now `grant.contract-test` when
  the grant plane moved out of this repository (root ADR-2608219500). The
  validators moved; the fixtures did not, because each `sensor.edn` here is
  paired with the `sensor.wat` the machine actually runs, and splitting a
  directory down the middle of that pair would have been the worse cut.

  So this is a cross-repository integration test on purpose: grant decides,
  and these are the aiueos-side fixtures it decides about. It is `.clj` rather
  than `.cljc` because it reads the filesystem; the namespace it exercises is
  portable."
