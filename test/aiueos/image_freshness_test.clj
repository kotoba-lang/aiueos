(ns aiueos.image-freshness-test
  "The boot-freshness receipt, shown in both directions (ADR-0155).

  What this namespace is defending is not a script: it is the meaning of every
  acceptance string in the K16 programme. `NIC-PARITY ok`, `TLS-PARITY ok`,
  `DEVCLIENT-PARITY canonical ok`, `DISRP`, `AIUEOS_DOT_F32_QEMU_OK`,
  `AIUEOS_QWEN35_ADMISSION_OK`, `KHSTCUGLWOZ` -- each is a string read off a
  serial log, and each is a claim about the tree only if something connects the
  bytes QEMU opened to the build that produced them.

  Every negative below pins the REASON LITERAL as well as the exit status,
  because `REFUSED stale-image` (4) and `COULD-NOT-RUN` (3) are the two answers
  that must never be confused with each other or with 0. A test that merely
  asserted `(not= 0 exit)` would pass while the tool reported a missing receipt
  as a stale image -- root ADR-2608136000's sixth question."
