;; `qwen35-gguf-header-valid.kotoba` against the GGUF v3 container header the
;; Qwen3.8-27B artifact actually carries.
;;
;; The object is a port of the opening of `kernel/qwen35_runtime.c`'s
;; `aiueos_qwen35_model_parse` -- the null/length/artifact guards and the four
;; header fields read before `parse_metadata`. That C is exercised on the host
;; by `scripts/smoke-qwen35-runtime.sh`, which builds an 10,996,640-byte
;; fixture with `tests/make_qwen35_header_fixture.py` and runs
;; `tests/qwen35_runtime_model.c` against it. This drives the Kotoba object
;; through the KIR interpreter instead, over the same 24 header bytes.
;;
;; Those 24 bytes are pinned here as a literal rather than read from the
;; fixture: the fixture is 10.9 MB of generated output, and a test that needs
;; it present is a test that reports green when it is absent. They are
;; transcribed from `od -N 24` over a fixture the C gate accepted, and
;; `the-header-is-the-artifact-s-own` re-derives them from the contract
;; constants so that a transcription error fails rather than propagates.
;;
;; Why the KIR interpreter and not the machine: the object compiles to an
;; x86-64 ET_REL kernel object and this workstation is aarch64, so nothing here
;; executes the emitted bytes. `kotoba.kir` models the same three window checks
;; the backends emit (`kernel-window-check!`), which is what makes it an oracle
;; for the bounds and not only for the arithmetic.
