;; ADR-0014 V0+V1 smoke gate for `aiueos.hvt` (issue #110).
;;
;; Runs the JVM/FFM self-owned-VMM boot spike (`clojure -M:hvt …`, which needs a
;; real /dev/kvm) and asserts its EDN run receipt: the guest must emit the
;; expected serial string via MMIO traps AND halt. Two cases:
;;   - default: the raw-word guest (`clojure -M:hvt`)               -- V0
;;   - elf:     direct-load the aarch64 ELF fixture and boot it     -- V1 loader
;; The KVM syscalls are JVM-FFM (nbb has no FFM), so this harness orchestrates
;; the spike and checks the evidence rather than making the ioctls itself.
;;
;; Run inside the Linux/KVM VM (needs kvm-group access):
;;   nbb scripts/hvt-smoke.cljs
