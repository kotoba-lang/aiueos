# ADR-0041 — aiueos is a cloud-premised OS: the local plane boots and brokers, the cloud plane stores and infers

Date: 2026-08-18

## Status

Accepted as positioning. It names an ordered gap ledger. ADR-0042 implemented
the decision layer for steps 6 and 7, ADR-0043 the hosted mechanism for the read
half of step 6, and **ADR-0073 the rest of both rows for the hosted profile**:
on 2026-08-22 this machine reached `kotobase.net`, `api.murakumo.cloud` and
`infer.murakumo.cloud` over TLS with pinned peer keys, read a block whose bytes
hash to its CID, refused one the store does not hold, resolved the
`murakumo-main` alias, **obtained and judged a completion**, and performed a
real `PUT`. Row 7 is closed end to end for that profile; row 6 has both halves
built and its write answers 401 for want of a bearer token.

**Step 1 closed on 2026-08-22** (ADR-0076), and the lease is **consumed as a
source address on 2026-08-22** (ADR-0081): DNS and cloud-TCP send from
`aiueos_dhcp_address()`, not from compiled-in `10.0.2.15`. **Steps 2–3 moved as
probes, not stacks** (ADR-0081): one compiled QNAME for `kotobase.net`, then
TCP :443 to the A, then a TLS ClientHello looking for a record. **Steps 4–5 closed on the QEMU UEFI profile on 2026-08-22** (ADR-0082): guest
TLS 1.3 Finished (cipher `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`) and HTTPS GET of empty raw
CID `bafkreihdwdcefgh4dqkjv67uzcmw7ojee6xedzdetojuzjevtenxquvyku`, body SHA-256
admitted by `kotoba_aiueos_digest_equal`. `clojure -M:bare-metal cloud` EXIT=0,
leftover `[]`. Chain/CertVerify are still hashed, not verified. Hosted
`cloud-live` / session smoke / a host curl still do not count.

Since 2026-08-21 the decision half of rows 6 and 7 lives in `kotoba-lang/grant`
(root ADR-2608219500) and the mechanism half here; `aiueos` requires `grant`,
never the reverse. Extends ADR-0019 (which split boot authority from workload
authority) and ADR-0030 (origin allowlists). It does not decide
install-to-internal-disk.

## Context

The intent is the Chrome-desktop shape: the machine boots and installs its own
verified system, and storage and inference live in the cloud. Two of that
shape's three legs do not exist yet. Measured on `origin/main` `d2ba6e7`:

**Boot.** The C-free native path builds `BOOTX64.EFI` and `KERNEL.ELF`; USB
removable boot is proved by transport equivalence — the same image booted over
`disk` and `usb` must produce byte-identical aiueos evidence (ADR-0019, 33
identical lines, `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)/USB(0x0,0x0)`). That evidence is
**OVMF-under-QEMU only**; no physical machine has booted this image. And there
is no install path: `os/aiueos/scripts/flash-usb.cljs` writes a release image
to a *removable* device and refuses internal disks by design. Today "boot
install" means "flash a stick and boot it", not "install onto the machine".

**Network.** Bare metal has the virtio-net link layer (ADR-0020), ARP + IPv4 +
ICMP (ADR-0021), one TCP connection that completes (ADR-0022), RFC 9293
§3.10.7.4 segment acceptance (`7182047`), DHCP (ADR-0076) **consumed as a
source address**, and DNS / TCP:443 / TLS-record **probes** (ADR-0081). It has
**no TLS client and no HTTP client in the guest**. `src/aiueos/net.cljc` is 41 lines of URL allowlist
for *host* adapters; `:net/fetch` is policy, not a bare-metal provider.

**Storage.** `aiueos.sealed-audit` and `aiueos.sealed-state` are local
AES-256-GCM sealed stores keyed by a KMS/HSM adapter; bare metal has an aiuefs
data partition. There is no client for any remote store in this repository.

**Inference.** None. `os/aiueos/kotoba/murakumo-join-plan.kotoba` *decides*
murakumo participation — 777 parity assertions against `murakumo.infer.join` —
and cannot act on it. ADR-0019 named that gap rather than letting the phrase
"AI mining server OS" imply serving.

Recording the positioning now matters because the difference between a
cloud-premised OS and a local OS is settled at the capability boundary, not at
the end.

## Decision

1. **aiueos is cloud-premised.** The local plane owns exactly: firmware
   handoff, memory/paging/W^X, scheduling, processes and syscalls, device
   admission, the capability broker and its policy, device identity and
   enrolment, and enough network to reach a named origin. Everything above that
   is a client of a remote plane.

2. **Storage authority is remote and content-addressed** — kotobase
   (`net-kotobase`, `kotobase.net`). Local storage is a cache plus the sealed
   state that must survive with no network: key material, enrolment receipts,
   the audit chain head, and the last admitted catalog. Apply the root deletion
   test (ADR-2608039000): erase the local disk, and a re-enrolled machine must
   come back. Anything that fails that test is a local premise and needs its own
   ADR saying so.

3. **Inference authority is remote** — murakumo (`api.murakumo.cloud`). aiueos
   never hardcodes a model id (root CLAUDE.md / ADR-2607173100): it resolves the
   `murakumo-main` alias, or takes an endpoint and follows whatever that
   endpoint serves. No inference runtime is admitted into the bare-metal
   profile.

4. **The seam is the existing capability broker, not a new subsystem.** Cloud
   storage and cloud inference arrive as network-reaching capabilities under the
   ADR-0030 origin allowlist, deny-by-default, one grant per origin. There is no
   ambient cloud, and a machine with no grant reaches nothing.

5. **Offline behaviour is a stated property, not a leftover.** A machine with
   its uplink down must still: boot to a verified kernel, verify its own
   enrolment, refuse admission of anything not already admitted, and keep
   appending to its local audit chain. Everything else may fail closed. This
   floor is a gate — boot with the NIC absent and require the terminal state —
   not a sentence in a README.

## Ordered gap ledger

What has to exist for the bare-metal profile to actually reach the cloud. Each
step ends in QEMU evidence; each has a spec owner already registered in this
workspace, so none of it starts from a blank page.

| # | Gap | What actually exists (measured 2026-08-18) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Address configuration (DHCP, or static bound to the enrolment record) | **closed for the bare-metal profile** (ADR-0076, consumed ADR-0081, 2026-08-22). A real DHCPv4 exchange — DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK — against QEMU's own DHCP server, with every judgement made by two compiler-emitted Kotoba objects: `dhcp-reply-valid` and `dhcp-option-u32`. Proved both ways. **DNS and cloud-TCP send from the leased address**; ARP/ICMP/guestfwd-TCP still use compiled-in `10.0.2.15` so the tamper gate stays a demonstration. No renewal |
| 2 | DNS **stub resolver** | **probe, not a resolver** (ADR-0081). One compiled QNAME `kotobase.net`, constant-offset A admission (compressed `0xc00c` or uncompressed copy). `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-dns` is still an authoritative *server*. No DNSSEC. Marker `AIUEOS_DNS_PROBE` |
| 3 | TCP from one connection to a usable stream: retransmit, window, close | guestfwd echo remains ADR-0022. **Cloud TCP :443 is a probe** (ADR-0081): SYN to the resolved A, then a ClientHello. No retransmit/window/close as a stack. Marker `AIUEOS_TCP_CLOUD_PROBE` |
| 4 | TLS 1.3 client and chain validation | **hosted client as ADR-0077**. **Bare metal: TLS 1.3 ClientHello→Finished + AES-128-GCM record layer, measured 2026-08-22** (ADR-0082, `AIUEOS_TLS_PROBE result=ok`). Chain/CertVerify not checked (same as hosted `:tls/not-checked`). `capability-crypto-tls` is still `contract-only` |
| 5 | HTTP/1.1 client | **hosted as ADR-0077**. **Bare metal: guest HTTPS GET of empty raw CID, measured 2026-08-22** (ADR-0082, `AIUEOS_HTTP_PROBE result=ok cid=bafkreihdwdcefgh4dqkjv67uzcmw7ojee6xedzdetojuzjevtenxquvyku`). P2 green on that serial line |
| 6 | kotobase client: block get/put by CID, ref read | read **and write both exist for the hosted profile** (ADR-0043, ADR-0073). The read is proved live: 200 with bytes that hash to the CID, and a 404 refused. The write performs a real `PUT` with the caller's bytes and refuses bytes that do not hash to the CID before the socket; against the live store it answers **401**, because this machine holds no credential. **Corrected 2026-08-21: it does not need CACAO.** kotobase's block plane admits `Authorization: Bearer <token>` compared string-equal against an operator secret — no signature, no scope, no DID, no verifier on that path. CACAO is the *tenant datom* plane. What this row owed was a bearer seam, which exists; what it lacks is a token. Ref read is still unwritten |
| 7 | murakumo client: alias resolve, then `/v1/messages` | **closed end to end for the hosted profile** (ADR-0073). Live on 2026-08-22: the alias resolves (200), `/ready` answers 200, and a `POST` to the endpoint it names returns a completion that `grant.cloud/admit-inference` admits — four characters, `finish_reason: "stop"`, shape `:chat-completions-v1`, from a peer whose key is pinned. The gate exits 0. **Two corrections**: the resolved endpoint names a *third* host (`infer.murakumo.cloud`) and already carries a path, so appending `/v1/messages` was wrong and admitting that host is an explicit operator decision; and there are **two** answer shapes, so the plan declares which one it expects rather than a reader sniffing the body. What is *not* covered: `api.murakumo.cloud/v1/messages` still answers 401 and no token for it is reachable here, so the credentialed surface is proved on loopback only |

**This column was corrected on 2026-08-18.** As first written it named a repo
per row without opening any of them, and two rows were wrong in the direction
that matters: `capability-*` repos are *authority contracts*, not providers,
and the DNS repos are the authoritative-server side of the protocol, not the
resolver side. A ledger that names an owner reads as though the work is
half-done. Steps 2, 4 and 5 start closer to a blank page than that table
claimed.

Steps 1–5 are the whole of the work. Three of them moved on 2026-08-22, in two
different senses and on two different days' worth of work: step 1 closed **for
the bare-metal profile** (ADR-0076), and steps 4 and 5 were answered **as
libraries** and proved by the hosted profile (ADR-0077), which is not the same
thing. **ADR-0081 then moved steps 1 (consumption), 2 and 3 as probes on the
bare-metal profile**: the lease is used as a UDP/TCP source, one QNAME is
asked, TCP :443 is attempted. **ADR-0082 then completed TLS 1.3 Finished and
HTTPS GET of a raw CID on that socket (QEMU serial 2026-08-22).** P2 is green
when guest serial has `AIUEOS_HTTP_PROBE result=ok` with `cid=`; that line
exists on this profile. Hosted live and session smoke still do not count.
Once that GET exists *in the guest*, 6 and 7 are two small
protocol clients over an already-proved transport. The hosted Linux PID-1
profile (ADR-0011) has steps 1–5 from the platform and is where the two cloud
clients are proved first — the same split ADR-0019 made between boot authority
and workload authority. That is what ADR-0042, ADR-0043 and ADR-0073 did: the
decisions, a hosted provider that performs the methods those decisions emit, and
an operator gate that ran them against the real hosts. **Hosted rows 6 and 7
being answerable makes the remaining guest HTTP gap larger in relative terms,
not smaller.**

## Non-decisions

- **Install-to-internal-disk is not decided here.** A cloud-premised OS still
  has to land somewhere. Whether that is A/B partitions on internal storage —
  Chrome's answer, and the natural fit for the OTA admission and device claim
  already landed — or whether the machine stays removable-media-only, is a
  separate ADR with its own evidence. The pull toward persistence is real: OTA
  update classes and enrolment receipts both assume state that survives reboot.
- **"Cloud-premised" is not "single-vendor-premised."** Root ADR-2608039000
  forbids a single vendor's conditional write as a premise on a distributed
  path. The storage plane here is content-addressed, and its ref plane must
  survive losing any one host.

## Consequences

- Read every cloud claim about aiueos against this ADR, and read it per
  profile, because the two answers now differ. **Bare metal**: the machine can
  boot from a stick, decide its participation, speak TCP to a peer on its own
  segment, consume a DHCP lease as a source address, and *probe* DNS / TCP:443 /
  a TLS record (ADR-0081), complete TLS 1.3 Finished, and HTTPS GET a raw CID
  from `kotobase.net` as the guest (ADR-0082, QEMU 2026-08-22). Chain is not
  verified. **Hosted**: it has
  contacted both, over TLS, accepting each peer only because its key was one the
  policy named; it has read a block, refused a missing one, and obtained and
  judged an inference completion. It has not stored a block, for want of a
  bearer token (ADR-0073).
- The local plane's scope is now bounded from above: work that would put a
  durable authority or an inference runtime on the machine needs an ADR that
  argues against this one, rather than arriving as an implementation detail.
- Steps 1–5 are ordinary, well-specified network work with existing spec
  owners. The risk is not difficulty; it is drift — a partial TLS or a resolver
  without validation would pass a smoke test and fail closed only in the field.
