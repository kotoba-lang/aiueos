# ADR-0112 — PLC provider precedes periodic ELF binding

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-26

## Decision

Land a kernel-side transaction-provider vertical slice for the two-input,
two-output motor example before changing the signed user ELF loader or the
general scheduler. It implements the capability IDs already emitted by the
Structured Text compiler:

- 16 reads the scan's immutable input image;
- 17 writes one previously unstaged shadow output;
- 19 records the single watchdog checkpoint; and
- 18 atomically publishes every declared output only while the scan remains
  inside both its budget and deadline.

Any malformed capability call, missing stage, missing or duplicate watchdog,
budget overrun, deadline overrun, or program fault suppresses commit, writes
the configured safe values, and latches the fault. A later scan cannot clear
that latch implicitly.

The RT-only QEMU build binds the exact PLC ELF SHA-256 from its build receipt
into the kernel artifact. A PLC-specific C-free Kotoba admission object checks
the canonical ELF segments and exact capability bitmap before the loader maps
the program RX/RW+NX at CPL3. The fixed-priority policy object is linked under
a distinct symbol and invoked directly from the APIC interrupt/context-switch
path. The priority-5 PLC task preempts the priority-255 kernel task; budget
exhaustion returns control to the kernel. Before mapping, the bounded Kotoba
P-256 verifier rejects a mutated signature and admits the supplied signature
over the exact ELF digest. The same task is replenished for 100 absolute
releases and re-enters the same ELF with a fresh data image and changing input.
Every native `syscall 5` sequence through capabilities 16--19 must produce its
corresponding expected outputs. The normal kernel build does not link or enter
this test profile, and the smoke's ephemeral private key is never embedded.

## Evidence boundary

`AIUEOS_PLC_RT_QEMU_OK` proves a native UEFI boot, receipt-bound generated PLC
ELF execution at CPL3, fixed-priority preemption through the native interrupt
switch path, signed ELF admission, tamper rejection, 100 absolute APIC-tick
releases of the same task, budget
replenishment, input snapshot isolation, atomic output publication, and
fail-safe provider vectors. It does not prove that one APIC tick is one
millisecond, a 10 ms physical cycle, long-duration periodic stability, WCET,
response-time admission, a production signature, or a physical I/O driver.
The marker therefore says `scans=100`, `cycle=10ticks` and
`timing=logical-unqualified`.

Deployment receipt generation now independently verifies a supplied P-256
signature over the ELF and binds the signature and public-key digests. It also
refuses deployment without qualified physical-I/O driver evidence, at least
10,000 physical WCET samples and bounded response-time analysis. The remaining
work is to obtain the production signing authority and real measurements, run
a long-duration soak, calibrate the timer and qualify physical I/O. Existing
general-app signature checks remain unchanged.

## Closure

This vertical slice is closed on 2026-08-26. Commits `428ab44`, `673438f`,
`48ba35c` and `d639653` progress from the native provider to receipt-bound CPL3
execution, repeated fixed-priority scheduling and signed 100-scan admission.
The closing QEMU marker is `AIUEOS_PLC_RT_QEMU_OK scans=100 signed-elf
tamper-rejected fixed-priority-preemption native-provider apic-release
transactional-output safe-state`; the ordinary UEFI build and PLC/RT receipt
regressions also pass.

The slice is complete at its stated logical-time QEMU boundary. Production
signing, timer calibration, physical I/O qualification, long-duration soak,
WCET/RTA measurement and safety certification remain explicitly outside this
closure and must not inherit its evidence claim.
