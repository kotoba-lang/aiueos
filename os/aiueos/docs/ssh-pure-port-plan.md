# SSH server → pure-Kotoba native graph: Gate-N2.5 port plan

- Status: planning (no code landed; this document is the deliverable)
- Date: 2026-09-04
- Branch: `ssh-port-plan-only`
- Scope: the SSH server component described by `os/aiueos/contracts/ssh-v1.edn`
  becomes pure-Kotoba objects on the x86_64-aiueos-kernel-v1 native graph, in
  dependency-ordered tranches, once Gate N2 (persistent TCP stream) lands.
- Docs convention note: ADRs live in `os/aiueos/90-docs/adr/`; this is a
  port-planning document, so it lives in `os/aiueos/docs/` and references ADRs
  rather than being one.

## 0. Ground rules this plan is bound by

1. **Authority chain (ADR-0106).** `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-ssh` (pure `.cljc`,
   605 lines across `ssh.transport`, `ssh.kex`, `ssh.keys`, `ssh.record`,
   `ssh.userauth`, `ssh.connection`) is the single source of truth for the SSH
   wire rules. Every new `.kotoba` object is a byte-for-byte port of named
   functions from those namespaces. The precedent is the C kernel's
   `aiueos_ssh_kex_h()` (`os/aiueos/kernel/main.c:386`), which mirrors
   `ssh.transport/h-transcript` and is proven equal to it by
   `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-kex.cljs`.
2. **Q9 whole-component migration.** The unit of migration is the whole SSH
   component: after the last tranche, every SSH *decision* (admission, framing
   validity, transcript assembly, key derivation, digest comparison, authorize,
   command route) lives in a compiler-emitted `.kotoba` object. A scalar shadow
   or predicate fallback does not count. Acceptance is `kotoba check` **and**
   `amu check --jvm-free` over the object set; no JVM anywhere in acceptance.
   The C pump (`net_ssh_*` in `os/aiueos/kernel/pci.c`) remains as
   decision-free *mechanism* only (socket recv/send, ACK ordering, NVRAM key
   load, `aiueos_random_bytes`), per ADR-2607241100 D6.
3. **Object constraints.** Target `x86_64-aiueos-kernel-v1`, default fuel tier
   1,048,576. Kernel objects take up to 5 i64 args (pointers + lengths). The
   kernel-target compile emits a fixed 32768-byte image `.text` region; a
   source whose emitted code region exceeds it cannot ship through the default
   path — the measured precedent is `ecdsa-p256-sign.kotoba` (kernel object
   50864 bytes, ~52 KB region, `.o` file 52264 bytes / `.text` 51421 in this
   checkout), which needed the ADR-0105 recipe
   (`os/aiueos/scripts/reproduce-ecdsa-sign-object.clj`: kernel-object entry +
   250,000,000 fuel tier + `package-kernel` stub, pending an upstream pin
   advance).
4. **Objects cannot call objects.** A Kotoba object is self-contained code
   (that is why `ecdsa-p256-sign.kotoba` carries a verbatim copy of
   `ecdsa-p256.kotoba`'s field/scalar helpers — the ADR-0030 copy pattern).
   Therefore every object below that needs SHA-256 or AES-128-GCM *inside its
   decision* carries a verbatim copy of the existing object's source, and the
   size estimates below are dominated by that copy.
5. **KIR cannot vector-test memory-using objects** (ssh-v1.edn
   `:crypto-bricks` note). Every object is measured by native compile + boot
   KAT; the host-side oracle is an nbb script that requires the org-ietf-ssh
   core.

## 1. Measured baseline (this checkout, 2026-09-04)

Existing pure-Kotoba objects (`os/aiueos/kotoba/`, `objdump -h` `.text` sizes;
file size is the whole relocatable `.o`):

| object | `.text` bytes | file bytes | on the SSH path |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| sha256.kotoba | 16,964 | 17,792 | yes — H, key derivation |
| x25519.kotoba | 20,867 | 21,696 | yes — Q_S, K (already in the 250M fuel set) |
| aes128-gcm.kotoba | 13,253 | 14,088 | yes — the GCM primitive |
| ecdsa-p256.kotoba (verify) | 48,219 | 49,072 | yes — host-key + userauth verify |
| ecdsa-p256-sign.kotoba | 51,421 | 52,264 | yes — KEX reply signature (50864 kernel object, 250M tier) |
| tls13-record.kotoba | 16,751 | 17,592 | no — TLS 1.3, shape precedent only |
| digest-equal.kotoba | — | 1,728 | yes — constant-time compare helper |
| hkdf-sha256.kotoba | — | 13,056 | **no** — SSH key derivation is the plain RFC 4253 §7.2 HASH loop, not HKDF; `ssh.keys` is the authority |

Reference point for the limit: 32,768 bytes (image `.text` region); the
ecdsa-p256-sign precedent exceeded it at 50,864. Everything this plan proposes
is estimated ≤ ~21,000 bytes of `.text`, i.e. under the limit with the same
kind of margin `sha256.kotoba` (16,964) already has — but each tranche
*measures* at compile time rather than trusting the estimate.

## 2. Layer-by-layer mapping

For each ssh-v1.edn `:transport` layer: the existing pure-Kotoba object that
covers it, the org-ietf-ssh namespace/function that is the byte-for-byte
authority, what is MISSING, and the measured-size/fuel risk.

### 2.1 Binary packet framing (RFC 4253 §6)

- **Covered today:** nothing on the Kotoba side; the C pump's `ssh_unwrap` /
  `ssh_seal` in `os/aiueos/kernel/pci.c` do the admission.
- **Authority:** `ssh.transport` — `u32`, `string-bytes`, `name-list`,
  `mpint`, `pad-length`, `packet`, `packet-payload`
  (`org-ietf-ssh/src/ssh/transport.cljc:60-119`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-packet.kotoba` — pre-NEWKEYS framing admission
  (length/padding validation, payload extraction) and payload framing. Pure
  byte mechanism on buffers the C pump passes in.
- **Size/fuel risk: LOW.** No crypto inside; work is linear in packet length.
  Estimated `.text` ≈ 2–4 KB (digest-equal-sized scale), fuel ≪ default tier.
  Largest hazard is bounds arithmetic (the `packet-payload` nil cases), which
  the KAT pins.

### 2.2 KEXINIT (RFC 4253 §7.1)

- **Covered today:** C builds it inline in `pci.c`; the name-list profile is
  baked.
- **Authority:** `ssh.transport` — `profile`, `kexinit-payload`
  (`transport.cljc:33-46, 121-141`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-kexinit.kotoba` — assembles the payload from a supplied
  16-byte cookie. Cookie *generation* stays C mechanism (`aiueos_random_bytes`,
  ADR-0103); the object does the deterministic assembly.
- **Size/fuel risk: LOW.** Fixed name-list strings; ≈ 2–3 KB `.text`.

### 2.3 curve25519-sha256 kex (Q_S, K, KEX_ECDH_REPLY)

- **Covered today:** `x25519.kotoba` computes the scalar multiplications
  (`.text` 20,867; already in the 250M fuel set with x25519's own entry —
  `reproduce-ecdsa-sign-object.clj:40-52`); `ecdsa-p256-sign.kotoba` signs H.
  What is missing is the *reply assembly*.
- **Authority:** `ssh.kex` — `ec-point`, `host-key-blob`,
  `signature-blob`, `kex-ecdh-reply-payload`, `ecdsa-digest` (the
  SHA-256(H)-as-ECDSA-digest rule), `newkeys-payload`
  (`org-ietf-ssh/src/ssh/kex.cljc:26-77`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-kex-reply.kotoba` — K_S blob, signature blob, the
  SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY payload, and the NEWKEYS payload byte. Takes (K_S
  point, Q_S, r, s) buffers; the ephemeral scalar and the `(r,s)` still come
  from the existing objects via C glue.
- **Size/fuel risk: LOW.** Assembly only ≈ 3–5 KB `.text`. The heavy objects it
  depends on are already landed and measured; the fuel story does not change
  (250M tier stays where it is — inside x25519/ecdsa calls made from C).

### 2.4 Exchange hash H (RFC 5656 §4 / RFC 8731)

- **Covered today:** the *hash* is `sha256.kotoba` (linked; ssh-v1.edn
  `:exchange-hash :hash :kernel-sha256-object`); the *transcript assembly* is
  C (`aiueos_ssh_kex_h`, `main.c:386-411`) mirroring
  `ssh.transport/h-transcript` (ADR-0106).
- **Authority:** `ssh.transport` — `h-transcript`, `exchange-hash`
  (`transport.cljc:143-169`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-kex-hash.kotoba` — the byte-for-byte port of
  `h-transcript` + inline SHA-256 (verbatim copy of `sha256.kotoba`'s source,
  ADR-0030 pattern, because objects cannot call objects). Inputs: (V_C, V_S,
  I_C, I_S, K_S, Q_C, Q_S, K) as pointer+length pairs; output: 32-byte H.
  This is the object ADR-0106 already names as the long-term home
  (`transport.cljc:17-19`: "compiles `ssh/exchange_hash.kotoba`"; this plan
  fixes the concrete name `ssh-kex-hash.kotoba`).
- **Size/fuel risk: MEDIUM — the headline measurement of this plan.** Estimated
  `.text` ≈ 19–21 KB (16,964 for the SHA-256 copy + ~1–2 KB transcript
  assembly) — **under** the 32768 limit, ~12 KB of headroom, but it is the
  largest new object in the plan and the estimate must be measured at compile,
  not assumed. Fuel: one SHA-256 compression over a 173-byte transcript is
  the same order as `sha256.kotoba`'s existing boot work (default tier
  suffices); verify the compiler-reported fuel ≤ 1,048,576. If the composite
  overshoots 32768, the fallback is the ADR-0105 recipe (kernel-object entry +
  fuel tier + `package-kernel` stub) — recorded here so nobody improvises it.
- **Oracle already exists:** `os/aiueos/scripts/ssh-kex-kat.cljs` (landed with
  this plan) computes H = `520a9ba70d60201af9365b0e53ffafa1a31446d17ec24315eb678a9b2e709833`
  and transcript length 173 from the org-ietf-ssh core for the exact fixed
  inputs the C KAT bakes (`main.c:390-398`) — the pure port gets the same
  oracle the C path had.

### 2.5 NEWKEYS (RFC 4253 §7.3)

- **Covered today:** C emits the one-byte payload.
- **Authority:** `ssh.kex` — `newkeys-payload` (`kex.cljc:68-71`).
- **MISSING:** nothing as a separate object. The payload is `[21]`; its
  emission is part of `ssh-kex-reply.kotoba` (T3) and the post-NEWKEYS state
  transition belongs to the record layer object's caller. Asserted by gates,
  not a new object.

### 2.6 aes128-gcm@openssh.com record layer (RFC 5647 + OpenSSH variant)

- **Covered today:** the GCM primitive is `aes128-gcm.kotoba` (`.text` 13,253)
  called from C; the nonce counter, AAD rule, padding rule and framing are C
  (`ssh_seal`/`ssh_open` in `pci.c`).
- **Authority:** `ssh.record` — `pad-len`, `nonce` (byte-wise 64-bit counter),
  `seal`, `open` (`org-ietf-ssh/src/ssh/record.cljc:27-83`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-record.kotoba` — the whole per-packet decision: framing,
  AAD selection (length field in clear), nonce construction, padding, and the
  GCM call. Because objects cannot call objects, this object carries a
  verbatim copy of `aes128-gcm.kotoba`'s source.
- **Size/fuel risk: MEDIUM.** Estimated `.text` ≈ 16–19 KB (13,253 GCM copy +
  ~2–3 KB framing) — under 32768, similar margin to `tls13-record.kotoba`
  (16,751). Fuel is data-length-linear (AES over up to a 32 KB packet); the
  existing object already serves the landed record layer, but the composite
  must have its compiler-reported fuel checked against the default tier, and
  the ADR-0105 tier path exists if it is not. Drift risk between the copied
  GCM and `aes128-gcm.kotoba` is mitigated by the KAT asserting byte-identical
  seal output and by the copy being verbatim (source-sha256 pinned in
  provenance.edn).

### 2.7 Session-key derivation (RFC 4253 §7.2) — implied by the record layer

- **Covered today:** `sha256.kotoba` does the hashing; the `mpint(K) || H ||
  letter || session_id` assembly is C (`net_ssh_userauth`,
  `pci.c:2594-2608`).
- **Authority:** `ssh.keys` — `derive`, `session-keys`
  (`org-ietf-ssh/src/ssh/keys.cljc:22-42`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-session-keys.kotoba` — four derivations
  (IV/key, c→s and s→c) from (K, H). Verbatim SHA-256 copy again (objects
  cannot call objects); the tradeoff — two objects each carrying an SHA-256
  copy, ~40 KB of kernel image total — is accepted for tranche independence
  and recorded here.
- **Size/fuel risk: LOW-MEDIUM.** Same SHA-256-dominated estimate as 2.4
  (~20 KB); four compressions over 74-byte inputs, default fuel tier. Note
  explicitly: this is **not** `hkdf-sha256.kotoba` — `ssh.keys` is the plain
  HASH loop.

### 2.8 publickey userauth (RFC 4252 §7)

- **Covered today:** `ecdsa-p256.kotoba` (verify, `.text` 48,219) verifies;
  `digest-equal.kotoba` compares; the signed-data reconstruction and the
  authorize decision are C.
- **Authority:** `ssh.userauth` — `pubkey-blob`, `signed-data`,
  `parse-userauth-request`, `userauth-success-payload`,
  `userauth-failure-payload` (`org-ietf-ssh/src/ssh/userauth.cljc:39-110`).
- **MISSING:** `ssh-userauth-check.kotoba` — parse the USERAUTH_REQUEST,
  reconstruct the `signed-data` blob exactly, match the offered key against
  the provisioned authorized key (`digest-equal`-style comparison is inside
  this object's decision), and return the digest/flag C feeds to the existing
  verify object. Refusal reasons (`:wrong-key :wrong-user :bad-signature
  :unbound-hostkey`) are this object's outputs.
- **Size/fuel risk: LOW.** ≈ 4–6 KB `.text`; no crypto inside (verify stays in
  the existing object called from C). The existing verify object is over the
  32768 region today (48,219) — it already ships, so nothing new opens there.

### 2.9 session/exec channel + the three commands (RFC 4254)

- **Covered today:** `ecdsa`-free C in `pci.c:2795-2891` parses
  CHANNEL_OPEN/REQUEST and builds the reply sequence; command dispatch is
  `aiueos_kototama_runtime_management_command`
  (`os/aiueos/kernel/kototama_runtime.c:172-196`).
- **Authority:** `ssh.connection` — `parse-channel-open`,
  `parse-channel-request`, `parse-channel-data`,
  `channel-open-confirmation-payload`, `channel-success-payload`,
  `channel-data-payload`, `channel-exit-status-payload`,
  `channel-eof-payload`, `channel-close-payload`
  (`org-ietf-ssh/src/ssh/connection.cljc:30-124`).
- **MISSING (two objects, split by decision type):**
  - `ssh-session-route.kotoba` — channel message parse/admit + reply payload
    assembly (confirmation, success, data, exit-status, eof, close).
  - `ssh-command-route.kotoba` — the bounded command decision: exact match of
    `runtime status` / `runtime restart` / `system reboot-pxe`, the response
    text build, unknown-command refusal. Side effects (runtime restart,
    UEFI cold reset) remain C mechanism calls the object's verdict routes to.
- **Size/fuel risk: LOW.** ≈ 4–6 KB each; linear in message length.

## 3. Missing-object summary

Eight new `.kotoba` objects (all new code; none replaces an existing object):

| # | object | ports | est. `.text` |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | ssh-packet.kotoba | ssh.transport framing fns | 2–4 KB |
| 2 | ssh-kexinit.kotoba | ssh.transport/kexinit-payload | 2–3 KB |
| 3 | ssh-kex-hash.kotoba | ssh.transport/h-transcript + sha256 copy | 19–21 KB |
| 4 | ssh-kex-reply.kotoba | ssh.kex reply/blob fns | 3–5 KB |
| 5 | ssh-session-keys.kotoba | ssh.keys/derive + sha256 copy | ~20 KB |
| 6 | ssh-record.kotoba | ssh.record + aes128-gcm copy | 16–19 KB |
| 7 | ssh-userauth-check.kotoba | ssh.userauth | 4–6 KB |
| 8 | ssh-session-route.kotoba + ssh-command-route.kotoba | ssh.connection + kototama command texts | 8–12 KB |

Existing objects reused as-is (no new object, no recompile):
`sha256.kotoba`, `x25519.kotoba`, `aes128-gcm.kotoba` (primitive; also copied
verbatim into #6), `ecdsa-p256.kotoba`, `ecdsa-p256-sign.kotoba`,
`digest-equal.kotoba`.

## 4. Tranches, dependency-ordered

Common gate definitions:
- **compile gate** = `kotoba check` + `amu check --jvm-free` clean; amu compiles
  the object for `x86_64-aiueos-kernel-v1`; compiler-reported fuel within the
  required tier (default 1,048,576 unless the tranche says otherwise); emitted
  code region ≤ 32,768 bytes (measure, don't assume); object + provenance row
  land in `os/aiueos/kotoba/` via `reproduce-kotoba-kernel-object.sh`.
- **QEMU gate** = boot in QEMU (`smoke-qemu-uefi.sh` under
  `AIUEOS_SSH_LISTEN=1 AIUEOS_TEST_NET=1`) with the object linked; the named
  serial marker is emitted and the named nbb gate passes.
- **physical gate** = same artifact PXE-boots on the K16 (RTL8125) and the
  marker/behavior is observed from outside the installer per ssh-v1.edn
  `:reachability`.

**T1 — ssh-packet.kotoba (framing leaf)**
- Inputs: none (leaf; only `ssh.transport` source to port).
- Host KAT: the org-ietf-ssh `transport_test.cljs` fixture vectors (hand-computed
  framing bytes; RFC 4253 §6 has no official vectors) — same vectors become the
  object's baked KAT.
- Compile gate: common; region ≤ 32768 (est. 2–4 KB).
- QEMU gate: new marker `AIUEOS_SSH_PKT_OK` — frame→admit→reframe round-trip
  against baked bytes.
- Physical gate: K16 boot emits `AIUEOS_SSH_PKT_OK`; OpenSSH interop unchanged.
- Existing test asserting the source of truth:
  `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/transport_test.cljs`.

**T2 — ssh-kex-hash.kotoba (H)**
- Depends: T1 (shared encodings), sha256.kotoba source.
- Host KAT: **the** KAT — `os/aiueos/scripts/ssh-kex-kat.cljs` (landed with
  this plan) pins H = `520a9ba70d60201af9365b0e53ffafa1a31446d17ec24315eb678a9b2e709833`
  and transcript length 173 for the fixed inputs of `main.c:390-398` /
  ssh-v1.edn `:kat-h`. The object's boot KAT must hit the same values.
- Compile gate: common; fuel ≤ 1,048,576 (SHA-256-dominated); region ≤ 32768
  (est. 19–21 KB; ADR-0105 recipe is the recorded fallback if exceeded).
- QEMU gate: the existing `AIUEOS_SSH_KEX_H <hex>` marker emitted by the
  object; `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-kex.cljs` passes unchanged (same
  want[], new producer).
- Physical gate: K16 PXE reboot emits the same H (extends the landed
  `:exchange-hash :landed` evidence to the pure object).
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/transport_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-kex.cljs`, plus the new
  `scripts/ssh-kex-kat.cljs`.

**T3 — ssh-kex-reply.kotoba (K_S blob, signature blob, reply+NEWKEYS)**
- Depends: T2 (H feeds `ecdsa-digest`), existing x25519/ecdsa-sign objects.
- Host KAT: fixture — fixed host key (RFC 6979 A.2.5 `d`) + fixed Q_C; expected
  K_S/sig-blob/reply bytes from `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/kex_test.cljs` (Node
  crypto oracle on both sides).
- Compile gate: common (est. 3–5 KB; no new fuel tier — the 250M tier lives in
  the existing x25519/sign objects called from C).
- QEMU gate: `AIUEOS_SSH_KEX_REPLY_OK` preserved;
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-real.cljs` passes — Node independently
  verifies the signature over H against the pinned host key.
- Physical gate: external client completes the handshake after PXE boot
  (extends the landed ADR-0107 evidence).
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/kex_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-real.cljs`.

**T4 — ssh-session-keys.kotoba (RFC 4253 §7.2 ×4)**
- Depends: T2 (K, H).
- Host KAT: fixture — `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_test.cljs` fixed inputs;
  expected IV/key bytes from `ssh.keys/session-keys` (RFC 4253 §7.2 has no
  published vectors; parity with the core is the oracle).
- Compile gate: common (est. ~20 KB with the verbatim SHA-256 copy).
- QEMU gate: derived keys identical to the C path's — the encrypted login
  still completes; `AIUEOS_SSH_AUTH_OK` path unchanged.
- Physical gate: login works on the metal after reboot.
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-auth.cljs`.

**T5 — ssh-record.kotoba (aes128-gcm@openssh.com seal/open)**
- Depends: T4 (keys), aes128-gcm.kotoba source (verbatim copy).
- Host KAT: NIST GCM vectors already covering the primitive + framing parity
  against `ssh.record/seal`/`open` with Node GCM
  (`session_test.cljs` fixtures); negative: tampered tag/length refuses (nil).
- Compile gate: common (est. 16–19 KB); fuel is data-length-linear — check the
  compiler report against the tier `aes128-gcm` effectively runs at today;
  ADR-0105 tier path if over.
- QEMU gate: full encrypted login + command session pass:
  `smoke-qemu-ssh-auth.cljs`, `smoke-qemu-ssh-session.cljs`.
- Physical gate: the unprivileged Mac transport (`k16-ssh-transport.py` via
  OpenSSH ProxyCommand) completes a session.
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-auth.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-session.cljs`.

**T6 — ssh-userauth-check.kotoba (publickey decision)**
- Depends: T5 (requests arrive decrypted), existing ecdsa-p256.kotoba.
- Host KAT: fixture — positive signed-data reconstruction from
  `session_test.cljs` vectors; negative vectors: wrong key, wrong user, bad
  signature, unbound host key → the four refusal reasons of ssh-v1.edn
  `:userauth :refuses`.
- Compile gate: common (est. 4–6 KB).
- QEMU gate: `AIUEOS_SSH_AUTH_OK` + wrong-key refused with reason (the QEMU
  half of the negative matrix).
- Physical gate: the **currently UNVERIFIED** physical negative checks in
  ssh-v1.edn `:blockers` (`:physical-negative-auth`) — wrong key and password
  refused on the metal. This tranche is where that gap closes.
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-auth.cljs`.

**T7 — ssh-session-route.kotoba (channel open/exec/data plumbing)**
- Depends: T5, T6.
- Host KAT: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_channel_test.cljs` fixtures (open,
  exec, data, exit-status, eof, close byte layouts).
- Compile gate: common (est. 4–6 KB).
- QEMU gate: `smoke-qemu-ssh-session.cljs` passes with the object producing
  the reply payloads.
- Physical gate: `runtime status` over the metal listener (extends the landed
  ADR-0109 evidence).
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_channel_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-session.cljs`.

**T8 — ssh-command-route.kotoba (the three commands) + whole-component check**
- Depends: T7.
- Host KAT: fixture ported from `kototama_runtime.c:172-196` behavior — three
  accept vectors (`runtime status`, `runtime restart`, `system reboot-pxe`)
  with byte-identical response texts, plus unknown-command refusal (the
  `:unknown-command :refused` clause).
- Compile gate: common (est. 4–6 KB).
- QEMU gate: command outputs byte-identical through the session;
  `smoke-qemu-ssh-session.cljs` command assertions pass.
- Physical gate: `runtime status` and the `reboot-pxe` ack path on the metal
  (ack-before-reset, UEFI cold reset to PXE — unchanged behavior, new
  producer).
- Whole-component closure (Q9): after T8, no SSH decision remains in C —
  `kotoba check` and `amu check --jvm-free` run over the complete SSH object
  set; the C pump retains only recv/send/ACK/NVRAM/randomness mechanism.
- Existing tests: `org-ietf-ssh/test/ssh/session_channel_test.cljs`,
  `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-session.cljs`, plus the physical
  `runtime status` evidence recorded in ssh-v1.edn `:openssh-interop`.

## 5. What this plan deliberately does NOT do

- No kernel source changes, no build, no QEMU run, no PXE-server touch, no
  merge — planning only, per the Gate-N2.5 scope.
- No rekey tranche (ssh-v1.edn `:rekey :not-in-r0`), no pty/interactive shell
  (breadth, not a missing layer), no ed25519/SHA-512 (rejected with measured
  cost in ssh-v1.edn `:crypto-bricks :rejected-ed25519-path`).
- No RFC 4253 §7.2 → HKDF confusion: `hkdf-sha256.kotoba` is a TLS-1.3 brick,
  not on the SSH path.
