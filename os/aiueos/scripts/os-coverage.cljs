;; How much of what AIUEOS claims does a real boot actually prove?
;;
;; Usage: nbb os/aiueos/scripts/os-coverage.cljs <evidence-log> [<evidence-log>...]
;;
;; Exit 0 measured, 1 findings, 2 REFUSED (could not measure). The third code
;; exists because "no evidence" and "nothing passed" must not look alike: given
;; no readable log this refuses to print a number rather than printing 0%.
;;
;; DECLARED comes from the sources, EMITTED from the logs, and only EMITTED
;; counts. A marker in a .c file is an intention; a marker in a serial log is a
;; proof. The gap between them is the measurement.
;;
;; Written for nbb, against the workspace's kbb-first rule for new tooling:
;; there is no kbb repo in the manifest and no kbb on PATH, so kbb-first is not
;; achievable here today. Port when it lands -- skill nbb-to-kbb-migration.
