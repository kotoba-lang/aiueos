;; The GGUF admission (ADR-0145) EXECUTED on a CPU.
;;
;; ADR-0145 moved the whole of `kernel/qwen35_runtime.c`'s parser into three
;; Kotoba objects and made the C delegate to them. Nothing ran that: the
;; objects passed a KIR-interpreter oracle, the image linked, and this
;; workstation is aarch64, so the emitted x86-64 had never been on a processor.
;;
;; This boots a real image under OVMF and hands it the 10,996,640-byte
;; metadata + tensor-table prefix `tests/make_qwen35_header_fixture.py` builds
;; -- the same fixture `scripts/smoke-qwen35-runtime.sh` feeds to the C
;; reference parser on the host -- through the model-handoff path, and requires
;; the kernel to print the numbers the objects derived.
;;
;;   nbb os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-qwen35-admission.cljs
;;     the fixture is admitted; the kernel prints QWEN-ADMIT reason=0 stage=0
;;     and the four representative tensor offsets the host gate asserts.
;;
;;   AIUEOS_QWEN35_ADMISSION_MUTATE=1 nbb …
;;     one byte of one tensor record -- the `type` field of
;;     `token_embd.weight`, Q2_K -> Q4_K -- is changed, and the kernel must
;;     refuse with QWEN-ADMIT reason=-21 stage=3.
;;
;; -21 is clause 21 of `kotoba/qwen35-tensor-table-bind.kotoba` ("token_embd
;; retyped, which the contract forbids"), and stage 3 names that object. The C
;; in this image cannot produce either number: under
;; -DAIUEOS_QWEN35_KOTOBA_ADMISSION `aiueos_qwen35_model_parse` returns 0 or 1
;; and every negative value it can report was written in a .kotoba file. That
;; is the discrimination this gate provides. It is NOT a claim that the C
;; reference parser would admit the mutated fixture -- it refuses it too, by
;; design, which is what `aiueos.qwen35-tensor-table-parity-test` exists to
;; keep true.
