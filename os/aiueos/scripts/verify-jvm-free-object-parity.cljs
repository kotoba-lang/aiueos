;; run of the other route. Both invocations go through `bin/amu`: the JVM-free

;; calling `clojure -M:run` the way the launcher does before this change.
;;
;; Evidence floors (ADR-2608136000): a source that could not be compiled by
;; EITHER route is :could-not-run, never :differs -- an unanswered comparison
;; must not read like an answered one. A pass over zero sources refuses with
;; its own exit code rather than reporting a clean parity.
