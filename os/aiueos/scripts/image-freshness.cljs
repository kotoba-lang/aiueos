;; image-freshness.cljs -- the receipt that makes a boot say WHICH kernel it ran.
;;
;; Why this exists (ADR-0155). Every acceptance claim in the K16 programme is a
;; string read off a serial log: `TLS-PARITY ok`, `DEVCLIENT-PARITY canonical
;; ok`, `NIC-PARITY ok`, `DISRP`, `AIUEOS_DOT_F32_QEMU_OK`,
;; `AIUEOS_QWEN35_ADMISSION_OK`, `KHSTCUGLWOZ`. The harness that produces those
;; strings builds an image and then boots it, and until this file existed
;; NOTHING connected the two halves: the boot consumed whatever bytes happened
;; to be sitting in the output directory. A run whose build never happened, or
;; happened three commits ago, printed the same markers as a run that measured
;; the tree in front of you -- root CLAUDE.md's "a check that could not run
;; returns the same value as a check that ran and found nothing wrong".
;;
;; Measured 2026-09-02 on aiueos c9f7506, before the fix:
;;   - `smoke-qemu-firmware-matrix.sh` boots `build/aiueos/esp` after checking
;;     only that the directory EXISTS. Editing kernel/main.c and running it
;;     produced a full pass against a kernel built before the edit.
;;   - a build that fails leaves the previous run's `esp/` AND the previous
;;     run's `kernel-serial.log` on disk, so the very grep every stream uses to
;;     collect evidence still answers with the old kernel's markers.
;;
;; The receipt closes both. `record` is run by the builder, immediately after
;; it produced the artifacts, and writes their sha256 plus the state of the
;; tree they were built from. `assert` is run by the boot harness, immediately
;; before QEMU, and refuses if either has moved.
;;
;; Exit codes are three, deliberately, and the same three everywhere:
;;
;;   0  fresh          -- the artifacts and the tree are what the receipt says
;;   3  could-not-run  -- no receipt, no artifact, no git. NOT a pass, and not
;;                        a boot failure either: the question was not answered
;;   4  refused        -- the artifacts or the tree moved. `REFUSED stale-image`
;;
;; Usage:
;;   nbb image-freshness.cljs record --out <receipt> [--root <repo>]
;;                                   [--scope <path>] <artifact>...
;;   nbb image-freshness.cljs assert --receipt <receipt> [--root <repo>]
;;                                   [--scope <path>] <artifact>...
;;   nbb image-freshness.cljs show   --receipt <receipt>
