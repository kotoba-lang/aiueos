;; The device half of the claim ceremony: poll for a challenge, sign it with
;; the key that never leaves this box, post the signature back.
;;
;; Until this ran, a claim reached `awaiting-proof` and timed out -- the phone
;; had scanned the label and the server had issued a nonce, and nothing on the
;; device ever answered. This is what makes a scanned label become a device.
;;
;; What it decides: nothing. Every decision is `grant.device-attest`, which the
;; control plane's verifier imports too, so the bytes signed here and the bytes
;; checked there come from one function rather than two readings of one spec.
;; What is here is sockets, a private key, and an exit code.
