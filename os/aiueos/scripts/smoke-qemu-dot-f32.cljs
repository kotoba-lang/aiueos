;; The f32 dot product, executed.
;;
;; `kernel-dot-f32` (kotoba-gmir ADR 0010) selects ONE OF TWO instruction
;; sequences at run time, from a `cpuid`/`xgetbv` guard: eight lanes of AVX2
;; where the machine has it, and legacy scalar SSE where it does not. The
;; compiler's own suites can assert the bytes of both; they cannot assert that
;; the two compute the same number, because that is a claim about a machine.
;;
;; So this runs it on two machines. `-cpu max` under TCG exposes AVX2 and takes
;; the vector arm; `-cpu qemu64` does not and takes the scalar one. The
;; experiment is that the eight hex digits on the debug console are IDENTICAL,
;; and that both equal the answer `kotoba.kir`'s reference interpreter gives for
;; the same input -- which is what "bit-identical by construction" has to mean
;; if it means anything.
;;
;; This workstation is an Apple M4 and Rosetta exposes no AVX, so TCG is not a
;; convenience here: it is the only machine available that can answer at all.
