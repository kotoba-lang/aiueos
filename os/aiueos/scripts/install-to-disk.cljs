;;
;; The pieces this composes each keep their own authority: install.mjs (a
;; ported, scope-frozen legacy asset) owns device inspection, admission,
;; exclusive-open write and readback; install-intent.cljs owns the
;; intent-vs-probe admission; this script owns the ORDER, the repeat-safety
;; check, and the target receipt. It never opens the target for writing
;; before both admissions have passed, and it never writes the receipt before
;; install.mjs has proved the readback.
;;
;; Repeat safety (decision 6): before installing, the last MiB of the target
;; is read. A valid install receipt there plus a valid AIUEOS GPT at LBA 1
;; means this target already carries an install -- an unattended run then
;; refuses with its own exit code (4) and names rescue/inspect, rather than
;; erasing the machine again. The non-empty-target refusal inside install.mjs
;; blocks the erase independently; the receipt is what makes the refusal
;; DIAGNOSABLE as "existing install" instead of "some partitions".
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 admitted (inspect) or installed / 2 refused with reasons /
;; 3 could-not-answer / 4 existing-install-found (rescue/inspect).
