;; fuel64: a fuel budget past 2^31, spent on a CPU.
;;
;; kotoba-native ADR 0078 widened the object replenish from an imm32 to a
;; 64-bit immediate, and kotoba-kir ADR 0268 put the ceiling at 2^53-1. Byte
;; goldens on two runtimes say the right bytes come out; a KIR test says the
;; oracle carries a budget past 2^31 rather than truncating it. Neither is a
;; claim about a machine, and "the ceiling is higher now" is worth nothing
;; until something has walked past the old one.
;;
;; So: `os/aiueos/native/fuel-wide-probe.kotoba` spends 2,200,000,013 fuel out
;; of a sealed 2,500,000,000 and returns. Under the ceilings that stood on
;; 2026-09-02, `kotoba.verifier` admitted at most 1,048,576 -- that budget
;; could not be compiled, let alone spent.
;;
;; TWO IMAGES, AND THE SECOND IS THE POINT. The same source is compiled at
;;
;;   2,500,000,000  enough   -> console `F1234O`, exit 33
;;   2,000,000,000  not      -> console `F123`, then vector 6 at the prologue
;;                              `ud2`, and NOT the `4`
;;
;; A run that only ever finishes is equally consistent with a guard that never
;; fires, and a fuel bound whose guard never fires is not a bound. The short
;; budget is also deliberately BELOW 2^31, so the pair separates "the counter
;; works past 2^31" from "the counter stopped working somewhere and nothing
;; noticed".
;;
;; THE MARKERS ARE ALSO THE RATE. QEMU appends to the debug log as the guest
;; writes, so a run that is still going can be watched, and the wall-clock
;; between markers is the charge rate on this host. That matters because this
;; workstation is an Apple M4: there is no x86-64 here except TCG, and TCG is
;; slow enough that the honest answer to "did it spend 2^31" may be "here is
;; how far it got and here is the measured rate". `--stages` reports the split.
