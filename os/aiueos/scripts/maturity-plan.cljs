;; Reverse topological order of the remaining gaps: dependencies first.
;;
;; Usage: nbb os/aiueos/scripts/maturity-plan.cljs [--next]
;; Exit 0 sorted, 2 REFUSED (a cycle, or an edge to a node that does not exist).
;;
;; The order lives here rather than in the contract on purpose. A hand-written
;; sequence is an assertion nobody can check and it goes stale the moment one
;; edge moves; an order derived from the edges cannot disagree with them.
;;
;; Kahn's algorithm. Ties among startable nodes break by LEVERAGE -- how many
;; nodes transitively wait on each -- and only then by name.
;;
;; Alphabetical alone was the first version and it was wrong in a way worth
;; recording: it nominated `amd-ivrs-isolation` as next because the letter a
;; sorts first, while `release-image-enumerates-devices` gates six nodes and is
;; the largest measured gap on the page. Leverage is derived from the same edges
;; as the order, so it cannot disagree with them; the name is kept as the final
;; tiebreak so two runs of an unchanged graph still print the same list.
