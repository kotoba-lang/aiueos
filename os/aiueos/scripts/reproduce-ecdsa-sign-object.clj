;; Regenerate os/aiueos/kotoba/ecdsa-p256-sign.o (ssh-v1.edn / ADR-0104,
;; ADR-0105). The pinned compiler (reproduce-kotoba-kernel-object.sh's amu
;; 9cf3a0a / kotoba-native a60da444) cannot build this object as shipped: its
;; kernel-object-entries has no aiueos-ecdsa-p256-sign, and its fuel tiers do
;; not put the ecdsa objects in the 250,000,000 tier a scalar multiplication
;; needs (the same tier x25519 already uses). Both are absences in the pinned
;; kotoba-native, not in this object -- the shipped ecdsa-p256.o (verify) was
;; itself built by a newer, uncached toolchain and does not reproduce under
;; 9cf3a0a either.
;;
;; So this recipe patches those two absences into the pinned toolchain
;; in-process, then compiles. It also stubs package-kernel: the kernel-target
;; compile eagerly builds BOTH a bootable single-object IMAGE (:binary, whose
;; .text is padded to a fixed 32768-byte region) and the relocatable object
;; (:object). aiueos links the relocatable object and never uses the image;
;; only the image hits the 32768 limit, so stubbing it lets the object build.
;;
;;   clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {io.github.kotoba-lang/amu {:git/sha "9cf3a0a..." ...}}}' \
;;     -M -e "(load-file \"os/aiueos/scripts/reproduce-ecdsa-sign-object.clj\")"
;;
;; The proper long-term home for the two patches is kotoba-native upstream
;; (add the entry + the fuel tier); this file documents and reproduces the fix
;; until that pin advances.
