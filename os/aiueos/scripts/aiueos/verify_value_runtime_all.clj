(ns aiueos.verify-value-runtime-all
  "Run every value-runtime verifier and write down what happened.

  The verifiers next to this file each compile one Kotoba object and check it
  against its contract. Nine remain here. Four left on 2026-08-31 for
  `os/aiueos/scripts/verify-admissions.cljs`, which runs on nbb with no JVM;
  coverage moved rather than dropped, and `:value-runtime/moved-to` in the
  receipt names where.
  Measured 2026-08-18: **nothing in this repository invoked any of them** — no task, no script, no test, no doc
  mentions them. They are not a check that passes; they are a check nobody
  runs, which reports the same green as one that ran (ADR-2608136000 question
  2, and ADR-0050 here).

  This is the invoker. It produces `qualification/value-runtime-baseline.edn`,
  a receipt naming the compiler it measured against, so the numbers cannot be
  quoted without their date and closure.

  Two modules have no verifier of their own — `aiueos.sha256` and
  `aiueos.digest-equal` — because they are *inputs* to the ones that do, and are
  compiled as part of them. They are covered, not missing. They used to be
  `value-runtime-sha256.kotoba` and `value-runtime-digest-equal.kotoba`, which
  were byte-for-byte copies of the sources the kernel's own `sha256.o` and
  `digest-equal.o` are built from; ADR-0140 deleted the copies and left the
  originals, imported rather than pasted in.

  The eleventh verifier, `verify_value_runtime_kernel_image`, is not a
  per-object verifier: it composes every value module plus
  `aiueos.native.kernel` and `aiueos.native.value-runtime-kernel` through
  `compile-project`. It is measured like the rest (ADR-0057).

  Run (the scripts dir has to be on the classpath, and it has to be `-m`:
  `-M <file>` loads this namespace and calls nothing, which is the same silent
  no-op this receipt exists to expose):

  Measured 2026-08-18, the ten failures are three classes, not one bug:

  - `:native-slice-typed-values` — the object uses a typed value the
    `x86_64-aiueos-kernel-v1` slice does not admit. The same wall
    `kotoba-kir`'s `only-native-word-typed-features?` describes.
  - `:native-slice-lowering` — admitted as a type, no lowering for the
    operation.
  - `:per-object-export-symbol` — the contract expects a symbol named after the
    object; the pinned compiler emits `kotoba_aiueos_probe` for every kernel
    object. Changing the contracts to match would give 57 linked objects one
    symbol, so this class is upstream work, not a local edit."
