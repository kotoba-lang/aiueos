;; USB removable-media boot gate (ADR-0019).
;;
;; A GPT release image only earns the claim "bootable from a USB stick" if the
;; firmware reaches it the way it reaches a physical stick: through the USB
;; stack, on a device that reports itself REMOVABLE, via the removable-media
;; fallback path `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` -- not as a fixed drive the firmware
;; enumerates directly. This gate boots the SAME release image twice, once per
;; transport, and requires:
;;
;;   1. the USB run booted through a USB device path and the disk run did not,
;;   2. the aiueos evidence of both runs is byte-identical, and
;;   3. both runs reached the same terminal state.
;;
;; (2) is the load-bearing assertion. Equality means the transport swap changed
;; nothing observable anywhere in the boot: same loader admission, same kernel
;; handoff, same Kotoba object results, same driver and storage evidence. A USB
;; run that merely "also passed" could still have diverged silently; identical
;; evidence cannot.
;;
;; This gate deliberately does NOT hardcode a passing exit status. It asserts
;; equivalence between two runs in whatever environment it is invoked in, so it
;; stays honest on a host whose QEMU fails the shared suite for an unrelated
;; reason (see os/aiueos/README.md, "USB removable-media boot"): if the disk
;; transport cannot pass here, neither transport is claimed to pass -- but the
;; transports are still proven indistinguishable.

;; Each application processor writes a one-character liveness marker ("A", "B")

;; on one boot, "ABAIUEOS_..." on the next, same transport). That race is a
;; property of SMP bring-up, not of the boot medium, and the shared UEFI gate
;; asserts the SMP evidence itself. Comparing from each line's own "AIUEOS_"
;; marker onward drops the racing prefix without weakening what is compared:
;; every byte the kernel emits as evidence still has to match exactly.
