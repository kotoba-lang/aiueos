;; The whole loop, against a server that verifies the way the control plane
;; does: issue a nonce, let the agent poll it, sign it and post it back, and
;; check the signature with WebCrypto over `grant.device-attest/signing-input`.
;;
;; The agent runs as a real child process, so what is exercised is the thing
;; that would run on a device -- argument parsing, the key file, fetch, the
;; encoding, and the exit code -- not a function called from a test.
;;
;; Two directions, because a loop that only ever succeeds proves nothing about
;; a device with the wrong key: the second run points the server at a
;; different public key and requires the agent to exit `rejected` rather than
;; retrying or reporting a transport problem.
;;
;; The classpath is passed twice on purpose: once for this script, and once
;; as an argument, because the child agent is a separate nbb process that
;; needs the same one.
