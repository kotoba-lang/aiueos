# DHCPv4 evidence, in both directions (ADR-0076).
#
# QEMU's user-mode network carries a real DHCP server -- gateway 10.0.2.2, DNS
# 10.0.2.3, leases from 10.0.2.15 -- so the guest talks to something that
# answers rather than to a simulation of one it wrote itself. No host network
# access is involved.
#
# FOUR BOOTS. One unmodified, which must configure an address; and three in
# which the received reply is broken in exactly ONE named way each, which must
# each be refused with the reason code that names what was broken. A run that
# goes red for a different reason than the one that was broken is not a
# demonstration, so each case asserts its own reason and rejects the others.
#
#   1  the transaction id becomes somebody else's       -> reason 5
#   2  the OFFER's message type becomes an ACK          -> reason 9
#   3  an option claims 255 bytes past the end of the
#      datagram                                          -> reason 8
#
# The tampering lives behind -DAIUEOS_DHCP_TAMPER in kernel/pci.c and is
# compiled out of every other build. It recomputes the UDP checksum afterwards,
# so the datagram stays well-formed in every respect except the one defect --
# otherwise the object would refuse at the checksum and the run would be red for
# a reason nobody chose.
#
# Nothing here hardcodes a passing status: each case reads the marker the kernel
# printed and fails if it is absent, if it is the wrong shape, or if the
# tampering could not be applied at all.
