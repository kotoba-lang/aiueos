;; WHY THIS EXISTS. `reproduce-kotoba-kernel-object.sh` pins amu 9cf3a0a and
;; its comment records why that pin has not moved: five objects were compiled
;; at the tip and compared against the committed bytes, and all five differed,
;; so taking the advance means regenerating every object and every pinned
;; digest in `build-uefi.sh` -- a change to the shipped kernel.
;;
;; Five is a sample. The decision that was deferred on it needs the whole
;; inventory: which objects reproduce, which differ, which no longer compile at
;; all, and for the ones that differ, by how much. This measures that and
;; writes a receipt. It does NOT take the advance, move a pin, or touch a
;; committed object.
;;
;; The receipt names the compiler it measured, because a reproduction count
;; without one is a number with no closure.
