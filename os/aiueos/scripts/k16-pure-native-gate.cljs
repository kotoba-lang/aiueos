;; The K16 pure-native NEGATIVE gate: refuse a link whose inputs are not all
;; Kotoba source compiled by Amu, or fixed stubs Amu itself emitted.
;;
;;   nbb os/aiueos/scripts/k16-pure-native-gate.cljs \
;;     --link-list <file> --provenance <file-or-dir> [--receipt-out <file>] [--root <dir>]
;;
;; Exit 0 = every input admitted.
;; Exit 2 = COULD NOT ANSWER (no link list, empty link list, an input that is
;;          not on disk, a provenance manifest that does not read).
;; Exit 3 = REFUSED: at least one input is foreign.
;;
;; WHY 2 AND 3 ARE DIFFERENT CODES. Root CLAUDE.md's six questions: a check
;; that could not run must not return the value of a check that ran and found
;; nothing. `verify-kotoba-kernel-object.py` -- which this gate re-implements
;; per object -- exits 1 for both, and `build-uefi.sh` treats every non-zero
;; the same, so a missing object and a C object are indistinguishable there.
;; Here `scanned=0` is exit 2 and never a pass.
;;
;; WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not compile anything, and it does not claim the
;; committed objects reproduce byte-for-byte from their sources -- that is a
;; separate and separately measured question (ADR-0129,
;; `qualification/object-producer-measurement.edn`). What it answers is: is
;; every byte entering this link accounted for by a Kotoba source and an Amu
;; revision that the repository records?
