# NOT linked here on purpose: kotoba/cpu-feature-nx.o, cpu-feature-syscall.o and
# cpu-apic-id.o. Unlike the four omissions recorded above and below -- each of
# which was a real missing link that broke this script -- this one is checked
# rather than assumed: the three objects replace `cpuid` sites in kernel/paging.c
# (NX), kernel/process.c (SYSCALL) and kernel/pci.c (MSI-X destination), and this
# path compiles NONE of those three files. It builds multiboot/entry.S,
# multiboot/main.c and reuses only kernel/acpi.c and kernel/apic.c, none of which
# ever contained a `cpuid`. Verified by linking: this script's output has no
# undefined kotoba_aiueos_cpu_* symbol. If this path ever reuses paging.c,
# process.c or pci.c the corresponding object must be added here, exactly as the
# MSR, ACPI and PIC omissions above had to be.
#
# NOT linked here on purpose: kotoba/kernel-context-build.o (and its ring-3
# twin kotoba/user-context-build.o, which this path has never linked either).
# Checked the same way rather than assumed: both are called only from
# kernel/scheduler.c -- `initial_context` and `initial_user_context` -- and the
# C this script compiles is multiboot/entry.S, multiboot/main.c, kernel/acpi.c
# and kernel/apic.c. scheduler.c is not among them, so there is no task
# scheduling on this path at all and no reference to either symbol. Verified by
# linking: this script's output has no undefined kotoba_aiueos_*_context_build.
# If this path ever compiles scheduler.c, BOTH objects must be added here.
#
# NOT linked here on purpose: kotoba/idt-gate-build.o. This path does not
# include kernel/main.c -- it has its own multiboot/main.c, which keeps a
# second copy of the same descriptor packing in C.
#
# The fuel objection to converting that copy is GONE. It used to be that
# install_idt_and_time_lapic's 257 gates (all 256 vectors, then vector 32
# again) would spend 257 of an unreplenished 512 across the whole boot, against
# 7 on the kernel path, so the conversion waited on a fuel-tier decision in
# kotoba-native's `bounded-memory?`. That predicate no longer exists: every
# kernel object now replenishes on every call, so idt-gate-build gets 1024 per
# call and costs a measured 1, and 257 gates cost 1 fuel each rather than 257
# out of a single lifetime budget. Converting the copy is now an ordinary piece
# of work, blocked by nothing here.
