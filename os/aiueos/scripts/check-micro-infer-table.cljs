;; Gate: the board's aiueos-char-bigram-v1 answers ARE the model the Mac relay
;; expects, measured by executing the Kotoba module rather than by reading it.
;;
;; Four things can drift independently and three of them are silent:
;;   1. native/micro_infer.kotoba vs kernel/micro_infer.c   (the frozen matrix)
;;   2. the board's unpack-and-reduce vs the reduction itself
;;   3. the board's answers vs MURAKUMO_MICRO_INFER_ROWS     (the relay)
;;   4. the board's answer for "murakum" vs the contract's :known-answer
;; Reading the files catches only 1. This gate executes the module.
;;
;; The compile-time KIR oracle folds an effect-free i64 `main`, so
;;   (quot 1 (- 1 (self-check)))
;; compiles when every row reduces to its expected value and refuses with
;; `division-by-zero` when exactly one has drifted. That is the discriminator,
;; and this gate DEMONSTRATES it in both directions every run: it mutates one
;; row of a COPY and requires that copy to fail. A gate that has only ever been
;; green cannot be told from a gate that cannot go red.
;;
;; Exit 0 = clean, 1 = findings, 2 = REFUSED (could not answer).
