;; The offline floor: a machine with no NIC still reaches its terminal state,
;; and losing the network loses nothing but the network.
;;
;; ADR-0041 decided that a cloud-premised OS must state what it can still do
;; with its uplink down, and said the floor "is a gate -- boot with the NIC
;; absent and require the terminal state -- not a sentence in a README". It
;; stayed a sentence for ten iterations of the loop that wrote it.
;;
;; Measured 2026-08-18, the property already held: `smoke-qemu-uefi.sh` attaches
;; a NIC only when AIUEOS_TEST_NET=1, so every existing gate has been booting
;; the NIC-absent machine all along, and the kernel emits
;; AIUEOS_VIRTIO_NET_ABSENT when it finds none. **Nothing asserted any of it.**
;; A property that holds because of a default is one flip of that default away
;; from being untrue with every gate still green.
;;
;; So this is an equivalence gate, in the shape ADR-0019 used for USB versus
;; disk: run the same image both ways and require a stated relation between the
;; two, rather than two independent green checks that could both drift.
;;
;;   - both runs reach AIUEOS_UEFI_SMOKE_OK;
;;   - the NIC-absent run says AIUEOS_VIRTIO_NET_ABSENT -- it noticed, rather
;;     than skipping the network silently, which is the failure this whole
;;     series keeps finding;
;;   - every marker the NIC-absent run produces, except that one, also appears
;;     in the NIC-present run: removing the NIC removed nothing else;
;;   - the markers only the NIC-present run has are exactly the network ones.
;;
;; Requires a built KERNEL.ELF and BOOTX64.EFI (build-kotoba-native-kernel.sh
;; and build-kotoba-native-boot.sh), the same inputs smoke-qemu-uefi.sh needs.
