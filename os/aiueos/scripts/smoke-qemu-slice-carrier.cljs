;; The ADR 0285 slice carrier, executed.
;;
;; Everything else about `[:slice T]` is a claim about bytes. amu ADR 0314
;; shows that a carried traversal and a hand-written `(slice-load-u8 base
;; length index)` traversal compile to IDENTICAL objects on both ISAs, which
;; is the right thing to check and is not the same as checking that the object
;; addresses the memory it says it does. That is a claim about a machine.
;;
;; So this boots one. `os/aiueos/native/slice-carrier-probe.kotoba` builds a
;; `[:slice :u8]` over a real conventional-memory page, PASSES IT AS A
;; FUNCTION PARAMETER, writes a pattern through it, sums it back, narrows it
;; with `slice-sub` and sums the narrowing. Nothing in the probe reconstructs
;; the slice from two i64s at a call site -- `main` builds it once and hands
;; the value on.
;;
;; The console is <whole:8 hex><tail:8 hex>"SLC":
;;
;;   00000820   1 + 2 + ... + 64   = 2080, the whole slice
;;   00000410  17 + 18 + ... + 48  = 1040, (slice-sub s 16 32)
;;
;; The second is what makes the narrowing readable rather than plausible.
;; Measured 2026-09-02 by editing the probe and re-running:
;;
;;   (slice-sub s 0 32)   -> 00000820 00000210 SLC, exit 27  (offset ignored)
;;   (slice-sub s 48 32)  -> EMPTY console, exit 0           (48+32 > 64: the
;;                                                            narrowing traps
;;                                                            before printing)
