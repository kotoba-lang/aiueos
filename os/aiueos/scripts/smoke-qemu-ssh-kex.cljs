;; Gate for the SSH curve25519-sha256 exchange hash H (ssh-v1.edn / ADR-0106):
;; the kernel assembles the RFC 5656 §4 transcript and SHA-256s it, and the H it
;; emits must equal the H that ssh.transport computes for the SAME fixed inputs.
;;
;; This is the IMPORT WITH TEETH. ssh.transport is the shared wire-rule core in
;; kotoba-lang/org-ietf-ssh; this gate REQUIRES it (so it must be on the
;; classpath) and recomputes the reference H here. The kernel bakes that same H
;; as its self-check want[], but the authority is the core: if org-ietf-ssh's
;; transcript order or encoding ever changes, the recomputed H moves, the
;; kernel's emitted hex (still equal to the stale baked want) no longer matches,
;; and this gate goes red -- even though the kernel self-reports OK. A gate that
;; only trusted the kernel's own AIUEOS_SSH_KEX_OK would be a self-report.
;;
;; Run from the superproject root so the west checkout of org-ietf-ssh is on the
;; classpath:
;;   nbb --classpath orgs/kotoba-lang/org-ietf-ssh/src \
;;       orgs/kotoba-lang/aiueos/os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-ssh-kex.cljs
;; Build the kernel with AIUEOS_SSH_LISTEN=1 first (the KEX KAT rides under it).
