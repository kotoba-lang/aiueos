;; measure-boot-flake-rate.cljs -- boot ONE already-built image N times and say
;; what actually happened, run by run (ADR-0200).
;;
;; Why this exists. `smoke-qemu-uefi.sh` retried any timeout and called it
;; "known flake kotoba-lang/aiueos#108", three attempts at ten minutes each.
;; Nobody had measured the rate that retry was budgeted for, and the issue it
;; names records "never reproduced locally (macOS, QEMU 10, faster host)" --
;; which is this host. A retry budget nobody measured is not a measurement, so
;; this is the thing that measures it.
;;
;; It rebuilds nothing on purpose: the question is how often the SAME bytes
;; boot differently, and a rebuild between runs would make a compiler change
;; and a flake look alike. Point it at an AIUEOS_OUT that `build-uefi.sh` has
;; already filled.
;;
;;   nbb os/aiueos/scripts/measure-boot-flake-rate.cljs \
;;       --out build/aiueos --runs 12 [--timeout 180]
;;
;; Exit codes, and they mean three different things:
;;   0  every run reached the same verdict; the distribution and the flake rate
;;      are printed with n
;;   1  at least one run disagreed with the others -- a real finding, not a
;;      failure of this script
;;   3  COULD-NOT-RUN: no image, no qemu, no OVMF, or --runs below the floor.
;;      Never a pass. A rate computed from zero boots is not a low rate.
