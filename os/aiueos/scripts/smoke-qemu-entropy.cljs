;; alive after enumeration and aiueos_random_bytes delivers fresh device bytes.
;; Green iff the boot's self-test marker AIUEOS_RANDOM_OK is present -- two
;; distinct, non-constant 32-byte batches, checked in the kernel. Built with
;; AIUEOS_SSH_LISTEN=1 (the self-test lives behind that flag); driven by
;; smoke-qemu-uefi.sh, the harness proven to boot fully on this machine.
