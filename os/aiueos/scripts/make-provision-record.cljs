;; Generate the per-device SSH provisioning record (ssh-v1.edn, install-v1.edn
;; decision 4). Run at install time on the target, never at USB-build time:
;; the host-key seed is a secret and the secret floor forbids it ever touching
;; the install USB, a log, or a reused stick. The authorized key is copied
;; from the install intent, never invented.
;;
;;   nbb make-provision-record.cljs \
;;     --intent install-intent.json --out /path/provision.json
;;     [--host-seed <64-hex>]     ; TEST ONLY -- inject a fixed seed for vectors
;;
;; Output record (aiueos.provision.v1):
;;   {hostname, deviceClaim?, installIntentSha256, createdAt,
;;    sshHostKey: {algo, seedSha256, public, openssh, fingerprint},
;;    authorizedKeys: [{principal, algo, public, openssh, fingerprint}]}
;;
;; Only the PUBLIC halves are printed. The record file itself carries the seed
;; (the record is written to the target's private provision region, which is
;; where the seed must live for the kernel to sign with the host key); the
;; file is created 0600 and the seed is never echoed. `--emit-seed` is refused
;; outside NODE_ENV=test.
