;; Gate for the SSH passive-open listener (ssh-v1.edn / ADR-0102): the kernel
;; accepts ONE inbound TCP connection on port 22 and exchanges SSH-2.0
;; identification strings with a real external client. No crypto -- this proves
;; the two blockers under the crypto (no LISTEN/accept, and no post-evidence
;; service loop) are gone.
;;
;; The boot is driven by smoke-qemu-uefi.sh, the SAME harness the other network
;; gates (offline-floor, dhcp) use and the one proven to reach the network
;; evidence on this machine. AIUEOS_TEST_NET=1 attaches the NIC; the new
;; AIUEOS_SSH_HOSTFWD adds a host->guest:22 forward so an external node client
;; can connect IN. The kernel must be built with AIUEOS_SSH_LISTEN=1.
;;
;; The client is cooperating -- it waits for the server's id line before
;; sending its own -- because the guest's one-buffer RX stack drops
;; back-to-back segments. Green iff the serial shows AIUEOS_SSH_LISTEN_OK AND
;; the client read exactly "SSH-2.0-aiueos_0.1" from the kernel: the marker
;; alone could be a self-report, the client read alone could be anyone.

;; the listener's window there is at least one live host socket whose SLIRP
;; SYN the guest can complete. The guest completes exactly one; whichever host
;; socket maps to it reads the banner. First banner wins and stops the pool.
