;;
;;   --amu <dir>        an amu checkout to compile with (required)
;;   --provenance <f>   default os/aiueos/kotoba/provenance.edn
;;   --root <dir>       repository root, default cwd
;;   --objects a.o,b.o  only these
;;   --jobs N           parallel compiles, default 4
;;   --allow-drift      compile with the amu at --amu even when it is not the
;;                      revision the receipt records (the verdict is then
;;                      :drift, and --allow-drift keeps that from failing)
;;   --attest           write the freshly produced bytes over the committed
;;                      objects and rewrite the provenance manifest to record
;;                      THIS amu
;;   --keep <dir>       keep the freshly produced objects here
;;
;; Exit 0 = every object reproduced (or, under --attest, every object compiled).
;; Exit 2 = COULD NOT RUN: no amu, a dirty amu tree, a receipt that does not
;;          read, a source that is not on disk, a compile that did not produce
;;          an object. `scanned=0` is exit 2 and never a pass.
;; Exit 3 = at least one object did not reproduce.
;;
;; WHY THIS REPLACES THE OLD RECIPES. `reproduce-kotoba-kernel-object.sh` named
;; 45 of the objects and pinned one amu revision in a shell variable;
;; `reproduce-ecdsa-sign-object.clj` named 2 more and patched the pinned
;; toolchain in-process. Between them, 26 committed objects had no recipe at
;; all, and neither script could say whether the revision it pinned is the one
;; that produced the bytes in the tree -- the pin was an assertion, not a
;; measurement. Here the pin lives per object in the receipt, the driver
;; refuses to answer when the amu in front of it is a different revision, and
;; the answer is a byte comparison.
