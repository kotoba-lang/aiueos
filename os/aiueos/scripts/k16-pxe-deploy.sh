# Atomic PXE deploy. The server read_bytes() the artifact at request time, and
# `cp` onto the live path truncates and rewrites in place -- so a transfer that
# overlaps a deploy can read a full-LENGTH file whose head and tail come from
# different builds. Both artifacts are the same size, so nothing downstream can
# see it: the panel showed one build's banner while the kernel came from
# another, and the machine died silently. rename(2) on the same filesystem is
# atomic: a reader gets the old file or the new one, never a seam.
