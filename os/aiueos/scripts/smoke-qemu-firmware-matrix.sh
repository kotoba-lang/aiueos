# Boot the same image under more than one firmware build and boot path, and
# require the evidence to be identical.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ADR-0019's A1 (and must not be read as it)
#
# ADR-0019 records that "produces a bootable image" and "boots from a stick on
# someone else's machine" are different claims, and that no physical machine
# has ever booted this image. This script does NOT close that. Every firmware
# it can reach is EDK2 -- the same upstream codebase in two build
# configurations -- so it buys *build* diversity, not the vendor diversity
# (AMI, Insyde, Phoenix) that a real PC ships. Real hardware also brings real
# USB controllers, real ACPI tables from a real board, and real timing, none of
# which appear here.
#
# What it does buy: the image is no longer proven against exactly one firmware
# binary and exactly one boot path.
#
# SECURE BOOT IS NOT ENFORCED HERE, AND A PASS SAYS NOTHING ABOUT IT
#
# The `secure` firmware is a Secure Boot *capable* build. Enforcement needs
# enrolled PK/KEK/db in the variable store, and the store this script hands it
# is the empty template -- which leaves the firmware in setup mode, where it
# will load anything. So a pass here is NOT evidence that a Secure-Boot-enabled
# machine would accept the image.
#
# That question is now ANSWERED, and the answer is no. Measured 2026-08-17 with
# PK/KEK/db enrolled into a copy of this same template (virt-fw-vars
# --enroll-generate ... --secure-boot), booting the same ESP under the same
# `secure` firmware:
#
#   setup mode  BdsDxe: starting Boot0002 ...        71 markers, exit 97
#   enforcing   BdsDxe: failed to load Boot0002 ...: Access Denied
#                                                     0 markers, timed out
#
# Same image, same firmware build, same boot entry; the only difference is the
# variable store. EFI_ACCESS_DENIED is the Secure Boot rejection itself, so
# this names the mechanism rather than inferring it from a failure to boot.
#
# It matters: business PCs ship with Secure Boot on by default, so an unsigned
# image means the customer must turn it off in firmware before the stick will
# boot -- which is the "power it on" promise, contradicted. Signing (shim via
# the Microsoft UEFI CA, or the customer enrolling a key into db) is a
# prerequisite for shipping, not a later refinement.
#
# THE ORDERING ARTIFACT THIS SCRIPT CONTROLS FOR
#
# The journal replay markers (AIUEOS_JOURNAL_RECOVERY_OK,
# AIUEOS_KOTOBA_OBJECT_REPLAY_OK, AIUEOS_OBJECT_TXN_REPLAY_OK,
# AIUEOS_PERSISTENT_SERVICE_BOOTSTRAP_OK) only appear when the block image
# already carries a committed journal, so the FIRST boot after a build emits
# four fewer markers than every later one. Measured 2026-08-15: comparing a
# cold first run against a warm one shows a 4-marker delta that looks exactly
# like a firmware difference and is not one. Every configuration therefore gets
# a warm-up boot that is discarded before the compared run.
