;; Standalone proof of the provisioning record generator (ssh-v1.edn,
;; make-provision-record.cljs). No devices, no install -- just the record.
;;
;; Every case pins a literal: the host key derived from a fixed seed must equal
;; the RFC 8032 test-vector-1 public key (so "we generated an ed25519 key" is
;; not standing in for "we generated the RIGHT key"); a non-ed25519 authorized
;; key must be refused with its own reason; an intent whose stored fingerprint
;; disagrees with its key must be refused. A generator that produced a
;; plausible-but-wrong key would pass a shape check and fail this vector.
