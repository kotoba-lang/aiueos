;; verify-smoke-freshness.cljs -- which boot harnesses can still lie (ADR-0155).
;;
;; A harness that boots an image is making a claim about the tree in front of
;; it. It can only make that claim if something connects the bytes QEMU opened
;; to the build that produced them. `image-freshness.cljs assert` is that
;; connection; this file enumerates who has it.
;;
;; It is a RATCHET, not a pass/fail on the whole set. Wiring all 40-odd
;; harnesses is not one change -- several build media (PXE, USB, GRUB,
;; multiboot) that cannot be exercised on this workstation. So the unattested
;; set is written down, with a count, and this refuses when the set GROWS. A
;; new smoke that boots an image without a freshness assert goes red on the
;; commit that adds it, and the existing debt is visible rather than absent.
;;
;;   0  the unattested set is a subset of the baseline
;;   1  a smoke boots an image with no freshness assertion and is not in the
;;      baseline -- or a baseline entry no longer exists / no longer boots
;;   2  COULD-NOT-RUN: no smokes found, or the baseline is unreadable. An
;;      empty scan is never a pass.
