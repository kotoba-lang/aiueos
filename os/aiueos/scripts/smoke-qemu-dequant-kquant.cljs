;; The two K-quant fused dequantize-and-dot instructions, executed.
;;
;; `kernel-dequant-dot-q4-k` and `kernel-dequant-dot-q6-k` (kotoba-native ADR
;; 0074) each select ONE OF TWO instruction sequences at run time, from the
;; `cpuid`/`xgetbv` guard `kernel-dot-f32` uses: eight lanes of AVX2 where the
;; machine has it, and legacy scalar SSE where it does not. Both arms are
;; unrolled thirty-two times, because a K-quant block's dequantization
;; parameters change part-way through it and its groups are therefore not a
;; loop. The compiler's suites can assert the bytes of all four arms. They
;; cannot assert that the two arms of a pair compute the same number, because
;; that is a claim about a machine.
;;
;; So this runs it on two machines. `-cpu max` under TCG exposes AVX2 and
;; takes the vector arms; `-cpu qemu64` does not and takes the legacy ones.
;; The experiment is that the eight hex digits are IDENTICAL, and that both
;; equal the answer `kotoba.kir`'s reference interpreter gives for the same
;; bytes.
