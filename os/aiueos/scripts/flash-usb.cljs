;; Without `--confirm`, this only inspects and reports: it never opens the
;; device for writing. `--confirm` must repeat the same device path, so the
;; destination is stated twice, independently, before anything is destroyed.
;;
;; Flashing overwrites every byte of the target, so the guards below are not
;; conveniences -- each one blocks a way this command could eat the wrong disk:
;;
;;   - the device must exist and be a whole disk, not a partition (writing a
;;     GPT image into a partition silently produces an unbootable stick);
;;   - the device must be REMOVABLE/EXTERNAL, checked against the OS rather
;;     than inferred from its name (`/dev/disk0` is internal on macOS but
;;     `/dev/sda` is often the system disk on Linux -- neither is safe to
;;     pattern-match);
;;   - the image must match its build receipt, so a truncated or half-written
;;     build never reaches hardware;
;;   - after writing, the same number of bytes is read back and digested. A
;;     stick that reports success but stores something else is a real failure
;;     mode of cheap flash media, and it is invisible without readback.
;;
;; This never picks a device on its own. There is deliberately no "find the
;; USB stick" mode: the one-in-ten time it guesses wrong, it destroys a disk.
