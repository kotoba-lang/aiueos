;;   0  every object scanned, nothing new has the shape
;;   2  COULD NOT RUN -- no disassembler, an object that will not read,
;;      `scanned=0`, or an object set with no self-tail loop in it at all.
;;      Never a pass.
;;   3  at least one object has it that the baseline does not know, and the
;;      report names the function, the slot, the single store, the loop label
;;      and the reload.
;;   4  the baseline is stale: an entry it records no longer reproduces. Not a
;;      regression -- somebody fixed one -- but the entry must be deleted, and a
;;      quiet 0 would let the file rot into a list nobody reads.
;;
;; WHAT IT LOOKS FOR, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE BUG. A self-tail function
;; compiled with a direct reentry edge keeps its parameters in registers and
;; jumps back to a label inside its own frame. If the register allocator also
;; backs a parameter with a frame slot, the store must be inside the loop,
;; because the recur edge REDEFINES the parameter. kotoba-mir spliced it at the
;; definition instead -- correct under SSA, wrong across the one edge that is
;; not -- so the store ran once and every later iteration reloaded the value the
;; parameter had on ENTRY. In `sha256.o` that froze `round-block`'s counter at
;; its initial value, `(= i 64)` never held, and the object spun until its fuel
;; guard trapped with #UD. Fixed in kotoba-mir ADR 0038; see ADR-0190.
;;
;; This checks the ARTIFACT, so it keeps answering after the compiler is fixed,
;; for any future edge that reintroduces the shape from a different direction.
;; It is deliberately not a source check: nothing in `.kotoba` says where a
;; spill goes.
;;
;; WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH. A slot written more than once (that store may still
;; be misplaced, but "written once" is the signature that discriminates), a
;; loop whose back edge targets the function entry (that form re-runs the whole
;; prologue and is safe by construction), and anything on AArch64 objects --
;; this tree emits x86-64 kernel objects only, and the parser is AT&T syntax.
