/* AES-128-GCM is `os/aiueos/kotoba/aes128-gcm.kotoba`, compiled to
   `kotoba_aiueos_aes128_gcm` (ADR-0132), and its boot known-answer test is
   `kotoba/aes128-gcm-selftest.kotoba` (ADR-0220). What is left in this file
   is the marshalling between the two shapes and nothing else: the S-box, the
   key schedule, the cipher, GHASH, CTR and the tag comparison -- 185 lines
   that held the whole confidentiality and integrity decision of every TLS
   1.3 record and every SSH packet this kernel sends -- are gone, and so are
   the 120 lines of vectors and comparisons the self-test was.

   TWO SHAPES, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT COSMETIC.

   * The object returns a REASON CODE and ZERO IS SUCCESS.  This file's two
     entry points keep returning 1 for success because `kernel/tls13.c` and
     `kernel/pci.c` have twenty call sites between them that read
     `if (!aes(...)) return 0;`, and a silent convention flip is the one thing
     worse than a loud one.  The inversion happens HERE, once, on the two
     `return` lines below, and it is the only place in the kernel that knows
     the two conventions differ.
   * The object works IN PLACE on one region; these entry points take separate
     input and output pointers.  So the input is copied to the output first and
     the object is asked to transform the output.  That is exact -- CTR is an
     XOR -- and it needs no bounce buffer: every caller here already owns an
     output region of the right size.
   * The object AUTHENTICATES BEFORE IT DECRYPTS.  The C this replaces
     decrypted first and compared the tag afterwards, so a forged record left
     attacker-chosen plaintext in the caller's buffer for as long as the caller
     took to look at the return value.  A refused record now leaves the
     CIPHERTEXT there instead. */
