   build defines it; the driver and its self-test are always present there. */

/* ==========================================================================
   THE DRIVER, WHICH IS NOW SEQUENCING (ADR-0140)
   ==========================================================================
   Every function below used to write registers and descriptor fields itself.
   They call Kotoba objects now, and what remains in C is the two things an
   object cannot do:

     * hold the struct -- which pointers and physical addresses this device is
       using, its MAC, its revision, whether it has been taken over.  A kernel
       object's loads and stores must be based on a literal, `kernel-boot-info`
       or an ARGUMENT, so a device handle it could read a BAR address back out
       of is not expressible; the handle stays here and its fields arrive as
       arguments.
     * sequence one object after another.  `rings_restart` is stop -> drain ->
       build both descriptors -> program -> enable, and a kernel object cannot
       call another kernel object, so the interleaving is here.

   `struct aiueos_rtl8125_io`'s six function pointers are NO LONGER CALLED by
   this driver.  The objects reach the device through `io.context`, which on
   this path is the BAR's physical address itself (kernel/pci.c:4068 builds it
   as `(void *)(uintptr_t)bar`).  The pointers are still required to be present
   because the header declares them and a caller that left them null has
   misunderstood the handoff, and because the parity self-test below still uses
   an io vtable of its own.

   WHAT WENT AWAY: `revision_from_txcfg`, `receive_config`, `mac_valid`, the
   sixteen register offsets, the eight command/status bit masks, the MAC
   assembly, the FIFO drain loop, the descriptor stores, the release and
   acquire fences.  `RGE_DESC_OWN` and `RGE_DESC_EOR` survive because
   `tx_complete` and the self-test's pinned table still name them.  */

/* `aiueos_map_pci_mmio(bar, 4096)` (kernel/pci.c:4056) maps exactly one page
   per BAR, and the objects refuse any other length -- so this is not a bound
   they check against, it is the length the mapping actually has. */

/* ==========================================================================
   THE KOTOBA PARITY SELF-TEST (ADR-0140)
   ==========================================================================
   Six Kotoba objects now express this driver's register sequence, its
   descriptor layouts and its status decisions.  QEMU has no RTL8125 model, so
   the evidence that they say what the C above says is this: run BOTH against a
   SOFTWARE MODEL of the BAR -- 4,096 bytes of ordinary memory seeded so that
   each register read returns what a real RTL8125B returns at that point -- and
   compare the bytes each leaves behind.

   That catches width and offset errors, which is most of what a driver gets
   wrong: a `write16` where the hardware wants a `write32` leaves two neighbours
   different, and an offset off by four writes into a register nobody meant.

   WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, said plainly rather than left to be discovered.  A
   memory model has no time in it, so the ORDER two writes happen in is
   invisible whenever both survive to the end.  Three things recover part of
   that and none of them recovers all of it:

     * The FIFO-drain stage seeds MCUCMD so the engine never reports empty.
       Both implementations must then return FIFO_TIMEOUT and must leave
       RGE_CMD at 0x8c -- the STOP bit set and the register NOT cleared.  That
       is an ordering assertion: the drain gate happens after the stop and
       before everything downstream of it.
     * The TX_BUSY stage submits twice.  The second must refuse, which is only
       true if the first actually set the OWN bit before the doorbell.
     * The store fences themselves are checked as EMITTED BYTES, not here:
       `verify-kotoba-kernel-object.py` sees the objects, and
       `rtl8125-ring-build.o` / `-tx-submit.o` contain `sfence` (0f ae f8).
       A fence writes no memory, so no memory comparison can ever see one.

   The seed values are not invented here.  `tests/rtl8125_handoff_model.c`:23-25
   already seeds MAC0 = 0x0bfc7070, MAC4 = 0x32b6, TXCFG = 0x64100000 and
   PHYSTAT = 0x0013, and asserts the resulting register file at :63-68.  So the
   fixture is the repository's own and a disagreement is a disagreement with a
   test that predates these objects.

/* WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE C WAS FLIPPED.
 *
 * Until the commit that made the bodies above delegate, this ran the C driver
 * and the objects against two copies of the same seeded model and compared
 * every byte.  That comparison is gone, and not because it stopped passing --
 * it stopped MEANING anything.  `aiueos_rtl8125_takeover` now calls the same
 * objects, so comparing them would be comparing one implementation with
 * itself, which is the shape a test takes when it can no longer fail.
 *
 * What replaces it is the table `rtl_parity_pinned` checks, and the table is
 * not a transcription of what these objects do: it was written before the
 * flip, checked against the REAL C driver in the same boot, and the QEMU run
 * that reported `NIC-PARITY ok` at that commit is what measured it.  It is
 * kept here so that the register file this driver leaves behind is asserted
 * value by value rather than asserted to equal itself.
 *
 * Everything else in this function survives unchanged in kind, because none of
 * it was ever a C-versus-Kotoba comparison: a submission that must set OWN
 * before the doorbell, a second submission that must therefore refuse, three
 * receive-completion verdicts, a rearm, a FIFO that never drains, and two
 * argument refusals.  Those assert the driver's behaviour, and they fail when
 * it is wrong regardless of which language expresses it.
