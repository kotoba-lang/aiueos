  "The kernel's single-byte trace values against the one registry (lang-h9).

  os/aiueos/native/wire-bytes.edn is where a trace byte's uniqueness is
  decided. This script holds the sources to it in both directions:

    duplicate       two registry entries on one channel claim overlapping
                    values ([value, value+span)) or the same :name
    hex-mismatch    an entry's :hex does not render its :value (doc rot)
    unregistered    a source emits a literal byte the registry does not carry
    range-on-scalar a source emits (+ base dynamic) but the registry entry at
                    base has no :span -- the base claims more than one value
    never-emitted   a registry entry that no scanned source emits (dead row,
                    or the emission moved without the registry following)
    emitter-drift   an entry's :emitter names a file that does not emit it

  Emissions are found by READING THE FORMS, not the lines: kernel.kotoba
  spreads one stream-log call over four lines, and a line scanner reported it
  as nothing. The byte argument is classified as
    exact    an integer literal, or (+ N (* 0 ...)) which is N with a
             sequencing trick, or every branch of an (if ...) of literals
    range    (+ N <dynamic> ...) -- N is the base of a range
    dynamic  anything else (a symbol, bit-and, a load) -- DATA on the wire,
             counted, never matched (see :data-followers in the registry)

  Refusals (exit 2, never a pass): registry unreadable or without :entries,
  an emitter file missing or unparseable, or zero emissions found. A scan that
  could not run must not return the value of a scan that ran and found nothing.
