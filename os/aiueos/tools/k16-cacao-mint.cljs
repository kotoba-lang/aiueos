;; Mint one CACAO with the K16 node's own did:key, for one murakumo route.
;;
;; WHY THIS EXISTS. The relay authenticated to api.murakumo.cloud with the
;; shared MURAKUMO_SERVICE_TOKEN -- an operator secret that is not in kagi
;; (`no such item`, measured 2026-08-15 and again 2026-09-08), is write-only on
;; the Worker, and is shared by `operator-authorized?` and `write-authorized!`,
;; so re-issuing it 401s every other caller. The K16 therefore could not talk
;; to murakumo at all.
;;
;; It does not need to. Measured 2026-09-08 against the LIVE server: every
;; route the relay uses -- POST /infer/nodes, /infer/queue, /infer/queue/:id/
;; claim, /infer/queue/:id/result, /infer/nodes/:name/heartbeat -- accepts
;; "Authorization: CACAO <base64>" whose `:iss` equals the `:did` the body
;; claims. The node holds that key. No shared secret is involved.
;;
;; WHY A SUBPROCESS AND NOT PYTHON. A CACAO's signature covers a SIWE plaintext
;; that mint and verify must agree on byte-for-byte; the workspace already has
;; that agreement in `cacao.edge.mint` / `cacao.edge.verify`. A second
;; implementation in Python would be a second chance to be silently wrong, and
;; ADR-2607320000 is the record of exactly that failure -- an identifier that
;; looked right and could not sign. So the relay shells out to the authority.
;; (nbb rather than kbb: this reuses a .cljs library that needs WebCrypto.)
;;
;; Usage:
;;   nbb os/aiueos/tools/k16-cacao-mint.cljs --key <pem> --did <did-file>
;;       --aud <url> [--ttl-s 600]
;; Prints the base64 CACAO on stdout, nothing else. Exit 2 = REFUSED.
;;
;; The blob is verified LOCALLY before it is printed. A mint that cannot pass
;; the workspace's own verifier must not reach the wire, where the same failure
;; would arrive as a 401 and read as a credential problem.
