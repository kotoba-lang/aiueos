;; Generate os/aiueos/native/relay_text.kotoba -- the ASCII skeletons of the
;; murakumo relay protocol, as i64 word literals the native kernel can write.
;;
;; The templates here and the regexes in os/aiueos/tools/k16-pxe-server.py are
;; the same protocol seen from the two ends, and nothing but this generator
;; keeps them the same.  So the generator does not merely emit: it builds a
;; sample of every line it can emit and requires the relay's own regex to
;; accept it.  A template that no longer matches is a compile-time failure
;; here rather than a board that transmits into silence.
;;
;; WHY WORDS, not bytes.  A `(defn x-byte [index] (if (= index 0) 65 ...))`
;; chain costs one comparison per byte per byte written -- 91 bytes of the
;; hello line is 8,281 comparisons against a 2^20 per-boot fuel budget shared
;; with a TCP stack.  Eight ASCII bytes fit in one i64 (ASCII is <= 0x7F so the
;; sign bit is never set), so a line is 12 words and the same write costs 144.
;;
;; WHY THE FIELDS ARE FIXED WIDTH.  The relay parses `score=([0-9]{1,5})` with
;; int(), so leading zeros are accepted -- every numeric field can be written
;; at a constant width and the board needs no variable-length decimal
;; formatter.  The ONE exception is `id`, which the relay compares as a STRING
;; (`got_id != str(job_id)`), so it must be echoed byte-for-byte from the
;; request rather than reformatted.  That is why the result line is emitted as
;; a head and a tail with the id copied between them.
;;
;; `--check` re-derives and fails if the committed file has drifted.
;; Exit 0 clean / 1 drift / 2 refused.
