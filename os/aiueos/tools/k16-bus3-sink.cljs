;; k16-bus3-sink.cljs -- the Mac end of bus3 (LAN2, en8): a UDP receipt sink
;; on 10.10.10.1:9000 that cannot hold a dead inode.
;;
;; Why this exists (ADR-0156, rig-h2). The previous sink was
;;   socat -u UDP-RECV:9000,reuseaddr OPEN:/tmp/k16-bus3-en8.log,creat,append
;; On 2026-09-07 its log file was unlinked while it ran. socat had opened the
;; file ONCE, so its fd kept pointing at the unlinked inode: every bus3 receipt
;; for hours was appended to a file nobody could open, while `ps` showed a
;; healthy listener and `lsof` a healthy fd. `k16-rig-check.cljs` now catches
;; that state (instrument `bus3-sink`: the sink path must exist on disk and a
;; nonce sent to 10.10.10.1:9000 must appear in it) -- but the sink itself
;; should not be able to get there.
;;
;; So this sink never keeps the file open. Every datagram is written with
;; open-by-name / append / close (`fs.appendFileSync`): if the path was
;; unlinked between two datagrams the next one recreates it, and the file that
;; exists on disk is always the file that receives the receipts. The cost is
;; one open per datagram, which at bus3's rate (a handful of frames per boot)
;; is nothing; at 10k datagrams/s it would matter and this is not that sink.
;;
;; Every line written to the sink is a receipt (one line per datagram):
;;   K16_BUS3_RX from=<ip>:<port> bytes=<n> hex=<hex> t=<iso>
;; plus, so a dead sink and a quiet wire cannot look the same:
;;   K16_BUS3_SINK_READY listen=<h:p> sink=<path> liveness-s=<s> pid=<pid> t=<iso>
;;   K16_BUS3_SINK_ALIVE received=<n> write-failures=<f> t=<iso>   (every --liveness-s)
;;   K16_BUS3_SINK_STOP signal=<sig> received=<n> t=<iso>
;; READY/ALIVE/STOP also go to stdout. A write failure is printed to stdout as
;; K16_BUS3_SINK_WRITE_FAIL with the receipt line, and the sink keeps running.
;;
;; Refuses to start (exit 2, named reason) when the sink's directory does not
;; exist or the address cannot be bound:
;;   K16_BUS3_SINK_REFUSED reason=sink-dir-missing dir=<dir>
;;   K16_BUS3_SINK_REFUSED reason=bind-failed code=<EADDRINUSE|EADDRNOTAVAIL|...> listen=<h:p>
;;
;; Contract with k16-rig-check.cljs (check-bus3-sink): the receiver process is
;; found in ps by `k16-bus3-sink.cljs` (socat's `UDP-RECV:<port>` form is still
;; recognised), its sink path is read from `--sink <path>` in argv (default
;; below), and the control datagram sent to <bus3-ip>:<bus3-port> must appear
;; in that file. Keep `--sink` and `--listen` as literal argv tokens.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   nbb os/aiueos/tools/k16-bus3-sink.cljs [--listen 10.10.10.1:9000]
;;       [--sink /tmp/k16-bus3-en8.log] [--liveness-s 300]
;; Prove the whole point on a scratch port:
;;   nbb os/aiueos/tools/k16-bus3-sink.cljs --listen 127.0.0.1:19000 --sink /tmp/x/sink.log
;;   python3 -c 'import socket;socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM).sendto(b"one",("127.0.0.1",19000))'
;;   rm /tmp/x/sink.log
;;   python3 -c '... sendto(b"two", ...)'   # sink.log exists again and holds "two"
