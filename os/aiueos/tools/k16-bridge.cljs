;; K16 bridge -- the Mac end of bus2's TCP stream (10.77.0.1:8443).
;;
;; Two modes, chosen on the command line so the log says which one stood:
;;
;;   debug   (default) The board's stream never sends first (it is a TLS client
;;           that has not yet been taught to speak), so a forwarder to a TLS
;;           server leaves every ESTABLISHED window empty -- measured 2026-09-07
;;           on kernel 47b8c209: five handshakes, forty-five empty polls (F1),
;;           not one admitted frame (F7). In debug mode the bridge speaks first:
;;           it sends one greeting, logs whatever comes back, and after
;;           --hold-ms closes the connection with an RST (resetAndDestroy), so
;;           the Mac keeps NO state for the 4-tuple. Without that, the next
;;           boot's SYN on the same port (the ISS is per cycle, not per boot)
;;           hits an ESTABLISHED socket and gets a challenge ACK, which the
;;           board reads as A4 (syn-ack window expired) -- also measured, cycle 6
;;           of the same boot.
;;   forward Byte-for-byte forwarder to --upstream host:port (what the Python
;;           bridge did). Kept for the day the stream carries TLS.
;;
;; Every line on stdout is a receipt; the rig check (k16-rig-check.cljs) greps
;; `K16_STREAM_CONNECTED from <ip>:<port>` verbatim, so that line's shape is a
;; contract. Run:  nbb os/aiueos/tools/k16-bridge.cljs [--listen 10.77.0.1:8443]
;;                 [--mode debug|forward] [--hold-ms 1000] [--upstream host:443]
