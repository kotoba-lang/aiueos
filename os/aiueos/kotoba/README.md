Run `scripts/reproduce-kotoba-kernel-object.sh /path/to/compiler` to compile the
checked-in source with that west-pinned compiler checkout and compare both
objects byte-for-byte. This pinned object is temporary cross-repository CI
input and may only be updated from a reviewed compiler artifact. The aiueos
verifier validates every supplied object before link and forbids host imports
or dynamic/runtime dependencies.
