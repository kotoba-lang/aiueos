;; Make this machine a murakumo node, on a Linux that already boots.
;;
;; The bespoke initramfs this replaces spent its time on hardware the
;; distributions solved years ago: an RTL8125 whose optional firmware does not
;; exist upstream at all, an ACPI table the BIOS gets wrong, a UEFI that would
;; not start a hand-built UKI. None of that is the product. A machine that
;; already boots Linux is the shortest line to a node.
;;
;; So this installs onto whatever is running: unpack beside a runtime, put the
;; key somewhere that survives a reboot, and let the init system own the
;; restarting. It is deliberately distribution-shaped -- systemd unit, /opt,
;; /var/lib -- because the point of standing on a distribution is to use its
;; answers rather than to carry your own.
;;
;; Run it with the runtime the bundle carries, so it works before any package
;; is installed:

;;     --endpoint https://murakumo.cloud [--prefix /opt/aiueos-node] [--dry-run]
