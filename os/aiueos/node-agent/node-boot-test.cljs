;; Everything the booted stick does after the network is up, minus the boot:
;; read its config, mint an identity, say what it is, and answer a challenge.
;; Run here rather than only inside QEMU because a boot costs minutes per
;; attempt and this costs seconds -- the QEMU run then has one thing left to
;; prove, which is that it also works from a stick.
;;
;; Two directions. The plane that holds the node's own key must claim it; a
;; plane that holds a different key must refuse, and the node must say
;; SIGNATURE_REFUSED rather than blaming the network.
