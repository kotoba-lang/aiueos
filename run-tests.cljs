;; run-tests.cljs -- the aiueos suite on a SECOND runtime (nbb / SCI).
;;
;; `clojure -M:test` on the JVM is the primary suite and this does not replace
;; it. What it adds is the class of defect that only a second runtime can see:
;; portable `.cljc` that is correct under Clojure and quietly wrong, or
;; unloadable, under ClojureScript. Measured on 1c11fcb, before any of it was
;; fixed:
;;
;;   - `aiueos.vfio` computed EVERY VFIO ioctl number wrong, because
;;     `(int \;)` is 59 on the JVM and 0 on ClojureScript. Nothing threw.
;;   - Nine of the thirty-three `.cljc` test namespaces would not LOAD, so
;;     they reported no failures by reporting nothing.
;;   - `aiueos.execute-test` and `aiueos.launcher-test` LOADED and ran zero
;;     tests -- every deftest in both is inside `#?(:clj ...)`.
;;   - Two tests in `aiueos.hvt-test` filled synthetic guest RAM with
;;     `(int \A)` and then compared against `(int \A)`: on ClojureScript they
;;     wrote 0, read 0, and passed while checking nothing.
;;
;; Three floors follow from that, and they are the point of this file:
;;
;;   1. The namespace list is DISCOVERED from `test/aiueos/*.cljc`, not typed
;;      out here. A list that has to be maintained is a list that silently
;;      stops covering new files.
;;   2. An included namespace that contributes zero tests FAILS. "No tests" is
;;      not "nothing broken".
;;   3. A namespace on the `jvm-only` list that turns out to define tests on
;;      ClojureScript ALSO fails. The exclusions below are claims about the
;;      code, and a claim nothing rechecks is how a temporary exclusion becomes
;;      permanent.
;;
;; Usage (matches fleet-ci's `nbb-cross-runtime` gate, which passes
;; `--classpath src:test:<git-dep srcs>` and runs this file):
;;
;;   npx nbb@1.4.210 --classpath src:test run-tests.cljs
